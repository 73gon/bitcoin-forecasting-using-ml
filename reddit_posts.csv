The report has convinced me further that I personally must buy and hold in order for larger spikes in the coming 4 weeks that he has predicted to occur. Short term greed Today and profit taking will damage greatly our opportunity to really make the price rocket by mid June. That's my personal understanding. Not financial advice but I will be buying and holding and fully expect a decent spike today followed by a sharp drop as hangers on and profit takers bail out but my personal thought is we will secure a higher end of day price if I buy and hold just like many others are stating they will do.",LABEL_1

##efforts underway to restore services and permanent connection with several villages; inventory for compensation  

**INFRASTRUCTURE MINISTER:** The dropping water levels have allowed us to bring construction machinery to the settlements that were cut off from Akhtala following the collapse of two bridges. The workers are covering around 5 km of [alternative] roads with gravel to make it passable. We will use helicopters to deliver food if necessary. 

The road for Haghpat and Tsaghkashat is usable. There are also works on the road connecting Shnogh and Akhtala.

A storage was created to gather food and other necessities for affected residents. Each region submits its needs and we send it to them. 

As of Monday, there were 4 deaths. Rescuers evacuated the residents of Sanahin. 

11 small and 6 major bridges have collapsed. We’re going to need quite an effort to rebuild them.

**REPORTER:** Are there food and water issues in villages? 

**MINISTER:** No. Most of the communities are located on the left bank of River Debed. Akhtala and other communities have plenty of food and grocery stores and there is accessibility with big vehicles. Yesterday we transferred construction equipment there.

**REPORTER:** What is the total population in this region and how many are isolated?

**MINISTER:** The population is 5,500. We have 2,500 residents in Lori and 1,000 in Tavush who don't have electricity. Work is underway to restore utility services. 

**REPORTER:** Why weren't the residents evacuated sooner? There were reports that Georgia evacuated their residents.

**MINISTER:** We also launched evacuation activities as soon as the water began to rise at night. Many residents themselves noticed and moved out. Rescuers saved over 400 people. The organizational effort is what allowed us to avoid a much larger death toll. 

**REPORTER:** What about before the heavy rain? Was it possible to evacuate the population before the rain? 

**MINISTER:** The level of precipitation and the scale of consequences are not always predictable. 

**REPORTER:** Will the residents receive compensation for the lost property?

**MINISTER:** Yes. We are taking inventory of the damaged infrastructure and we urge our residents to contact us to submit their losses, from houses to the goods lost in their shops.

**RESCUE SERVICE:** At the moment we have 429 displaced residents but most of them have since moved to their relatives' homes and do not need our help. We provide hotel rooms as necessary. 

Pumps are being used to drain water from buildings.  

We created a ropeway in Sanahin to evacuate residents if necessary. Yesterday we delivered them food and will do so today as well. Efforts are underway to end its isolation; we will install a mobile pedestrian bridge. 

The communities near Alaverdi that are isolated will receive the necessary items with our vehicles. 

We have 4 deaths. There was a report about a 5th person missing but information has arrived that disputes that the person was missing; we will clarify. 

**REPORTER:** Is there a risk of new floods?

**RESCUE SERVICE:** At this time we don't see a threat and the water levels are down by 105 cm. //

Two houses were washed away without casualties in Haghartsin, near the River Aghstev. A while ago the residents were offered compensation and told to move out because the buildings were deemed dangerous due to the risk of landslides. The residents had reportedly refused to relocate. 

PM Pashinyan held a meeting with the newly formed crisis group to [discuss](https://youtu.be/ue1v1rKztac) the restoration efforts. 

**PASHINYAN:** During my Sunday conversations with the residents and rescuers I understood that the scale of this disaster could have been much worse. It is the prompt response by relevant agencies starting late evening [of Saturday] that helped minimize losses. Right now we must focus on emergency humanitarian assistance, and in the long term analyze the details of this incident and discuss possible changes to the standards in housing and road construction for better resilience. The restoration of infrastructure is of strategic importance so we must contact the companies with reliable records and launch the restoration process. I understand that they already have a busy schedule but we must gather the construction resources to restore the infrastructure.  //

Pashinyan will instruct FM Mirzoyan to rally international support as the damages to infrastructure are expected to amount to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. On Monday Pashinyan met Georges Siffredi, the Head of the Hauts-de-Seine Department Council of France, and emphasized the importance of cooperation in the direction of restoring infrastructure. Georges Siffredi said they are ready to provide support.

2.5 km of railway tracks were damaged. Local and foreign experts will begin the restoration efforts today; it will take ""several weeks"".

##""we just need a few more days for them to collapse""; the pro-Russian former regime continues to shut down roads in Armenia and demand PM Pashinyan's resignation 

*EPISODE 1*

On Monday over 280 participants were briefly detained for blocking roads at the request of protest organizers Archbishop Galstanyan and ARF MP Danielyan. 

The police would often give an opportunity and 30-60 seconds for protesters to clear the roads, as in the case of Archbishop Galstanyan who was allowed to stand ""one minute"" on the road to give his speech:  

**GALSTANYAN:** We must show these people with our actions that we want their [ruling party's] political existence to end as soon as possible. We must do more and I'd like to use the opportunity to encourage those who are home to join the peaceful acts of disobedience and not follow the illegal orders of these people. We are fighting for the truth. This man [Pashinyan] is afraid and has sent berets to protect himself. He has nothing else to do. We just need a few more days to topple their prop. None of you should be afraid. Do not be passive while waiting for what happens. We are moving forward in a straight line and we will reach our goal to liberate our lives. This is not a political issue but the solution is political. This is a national liberation. I'd like to thank everyone who is carrying out acts of disobedience right now. Continue the same way. //

*EPISODE 4*

A group of activists and a sanitation worker closed the Moskovyan-Teryan intersection while drivers honked at them. The activists complained that Nikol was surrendering their ""homeland"" one piece at a time. 

One driver, dressed in what appears to be a military uniform and a Senior Lieutenant insignia on his shoulders, asked the activists to open the road because he was ""in a hurry for service"". The activist responded by saying the road closure is ""a lot more important"" than his service. 

The drivers continued to honk at them. One passerby berated the activists and told them to go fight next to Putin. One driver got out of his car and accused the activists of being paid. 

Another driver drove through the activists, striking two of them: [video](https://youtu.be/i-D7Q_m7c70)

*EPISODE 5*

**REPORTER:** The Sunday rally had 25% fewer attendees than the one on May 9. How do you explain this?

**GHEVONDYAN (political analyst):** Due to certain developments...

**REPORTER:** ... or perhaps lack thereof?

**GHEVONDYAN:** No, we've been warning that people who were disappointed in Pashinyan and attended the rallies were starting to get disappointed in this rally leaders as well. The number was down from 34,000 [on May 9, an hour after the launch] to 23,000 yesterday, and that includes the [groups who arrived from foreign states](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/1cz6uv4/what_happened_on_thursday_may_23_tt_news/) to join the rally. 

**REPORTER:** Yesterday Galstanyan led the crowd to Pashinyan's residency to ""talk to him"", knowing well that the PM was in a disaster area. Galstanyan said they would wait for his return, but then led the crowd back to the Republic Square. I'm under the impression that the organizers themselves understand their movement is failing but they feel ""obligated"" to continue, perhaps because they have made promises, perhaps they received funds from somewhere and now they feel obligated to use the money for its intended purpose. How else can you describe these actions?

**GHEVONDYAN:** Yesterday one of the participants of this movement asked me if it has a chance to succeed. My answer was ""define victory"" because the individuals who planned and led this movement have already won, if the goal was money laundering, or delivering on promises they might have made to someone, or they needed to see how many people they could rally at this time. Aramo to the rescue. The movement leaders themselves have accomplished their task. It's been 18 days, and none of their publicly announced goals have been met. On May 9 their goal was to remove Pashinyan within 7-10 days. On May 9 Galstanyan said he would leave the movement in 10 days, yet 18 days later he was named the candidate for PM. 

**REPORTER:** At first I remained silent on the reports that the protesters in Tavush were being bribed, but today money is something that's being discussed openly by pro-Azerbaijani Russian political figure Korotchenko. Earlier he became agitated that the funds sent to Armenia to certain ""experts"" were not being used effectively or on purpose. Yesterday Korotchenko revealed that ""hundreds of millions"" were spent on them with zero effect and he spoke about Galstanyan with sarcasm. Korotchenko said it was necessary to teach Russian language in more Armenian schools and he made ""corridor"" demands to Armenia. He then wrote the third post and basically said they had to speak with Pashinyan [due to the failure of protests]. This gives me the right to believe the theory that funds are being sent from Russia. This is a self-lustration. Why are figures like Korotchenko so openly revealing Russia's ties with the movement?

**GHEVONDYAN:** Korotchenko is not personally tasked to handle Armenia, it's the job of other Russian officials, but he wants the Kremlin to assign him to work on Armenia. Those who were assigned to work on Armenia have failed. Perhaps they should have ""talked to Pashinyan"" instead. 

**REPORTER:** If Russia gives up on this ineffective ""5th column"" in Armenia, and if we assume that Russia cannot use Azerbaijan to pressure [by invading] Armenia for now [due to Western pressure on Azerbaijan], and if Russia is too economically vulnerable and somewhat reliant on trade with Armenia in order to be able to impose economic sanctions on Armenia, what other options does Russia have?

**GHEVONDYAN:** That sums up Russia's capabilities today.

*EPISODE 6* 

[Murad Papazyan](https://youtu.be/iV6jYCzqkHs?t=410), the French-Armenian ARF official based in Paris, who was recently barred by the Pashinyan administration from entering Armenia, supports the removal of Pashinyan and believes it's important to restore the relations with Russia, calling it a strategically important move and describing Russia as the only partner with an agreement, according to 1in report. Interview with human rights defender Nina Karapetyan: 

**NINA KARAPETYAN:** The size of this protest is shrinking because their true plan is being gradually exposed. If at first their rhetoric was unity and homeland, then today we see the pro-Russian forces next to them and this has alienated many original supporters. If at first people truly hoped that Mr. Galstanyan was independent, that illusion has been shattered. This movement has sponsors that are pointing this movement towards Russia.

I'm truly in shock by the comments made by ARF's French representative Murad Papazian. He was speaking with excitement and պաթոս that Armenia has no choice other than to be with Russia. Brother, if Russia is so good, why do you and your children live in France? Why do you live in France but want the rest of us to live under Russian rule? Take your family members and ARF colleagues and move to Russia if you want to live under that regime. Go live in Russia. Go to Omsk, Tomsk, or Siktivkar. It is obvious now that this [protest] is a Russian project. 

Many initial supporters have major doubts now. It also baffles me how certain [pro-West] political figures with years of experience want to replace Pashinyan now without a concrete plan. You really want to remove Pashinyan now and allow a more pro-Russian figure to gain power; do you think that will make it easier for Armenia to Eurointegrate? //

Murad Papazian believes Russia and Armenia share similar interests in the South Caucasus and he is critical of the U.S. for wanting to increase ""Turkey's influence"" in the region by opening the borders with Armenia. Would you really want to work for a Turkish company in Armenia, wonders Papazian? *""Is it in Armenia's best interest for Russia to be weakened in our region and for the US or UK to strengthen?""* asked Papazian.

*EPISODE 7* 

French-Armenian reporter Leo Nikolyan was barred by the Pashinyan administration from entering Armenia a few weeks ago. He has been on hunger strike.   

**LAPSHIN (Israeli blogger):** I was asked to share my opinion about Leo Nikolyan who is relatively unknown in Armenia and France but is a big celebrity in Azerbaijani state propaganda outlets. Leo Nikolyan recently wrote that French President Macron had ties with Armenian militants, that France was sending spies to Azerbaijan, and that the French Ambassador to Armenia was supposedly involved in a multi-million dollar ""visa"" bribery. His visa story doesn't add up. 

Moreover, it's strange how literally 7 minutes after he uploaded a video, Azerbaijani outlets were all over it. It's as if they knew in advance he was going to release a video. The Azeri outlets were also the first to report that he launched a hunger strike at the Yerevan airport. //

Last week protest co-leader Archbishop Galstanyan expressed his support for Leo Nikolyan, urging him to return to France for now and return when the time is right.

##Yerevan news 

Yerevan resumes repairs on 55 kilometers of roads after heavy rains.

**MAYOR AVINYAN:** Residents often ask why certain road potholes are not fixed. The main reason is that the law does not allow us to carry out both patching and medium-level repair within the same year. //

Funds have been allocated to acquire 15 trolleybuses. Some of the contracts with the Chinese manufacturers have been signed. They will be delivered within 180 days. 

The city has also allocated the funds to acquire an additional 171 short buses. They, too, must be delivered within 180 days.

As for the 250 units of 18-meter-long buses, they will be acquired starting next year, also with the municipality budget, because the financial deal between an international organization and the national government is taking too long.

2024-05-27 22:52:03,$ZIM (a shipping company) scheduled to run hard into ex-divdend date June 4,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1d21zme/zim_a_shipping_company_scheduled_to_run_hard_into/,"(wrote this 5months ago but conditions r getting better than I orginally thought so posting here)

Are you into losing money? Do you want to buy a scratch off lotto on a new company (f\*ck video game stok)? Do you like to sniff glue or chug coffee mixed with wine because your a free thinker? Do you look like the type to do eeny meeny miny moe each time you decide which gas to put in your car?Well your in the right thread.

Let me introduce you to $zim a shipping company. That recently had a huge impairment loss a month ago as a result their dividend for the foreseeable future has been canceled. Per law of the country they are located in unprofitable companies can't issue dividends. So all boomer in it for the dividends have left.

Check the CEO statements after the impairment loss

""“We expect the industry will be under severe pressure for the foreseeable future,” said Xavier Destriau, CFO of Israel-based Zim (NYSE: ZIM), the world’s 10th-largest ocean carrier. “We have little hope for a meaningful recovery in 2024.”

According to Zim CEO Eli Glickman, “Rate increases we saw in August in the trans-Pacific were short-lived.” He predicted that “2025 will mark a turning point and a return to profitability.”

According to Destriau, “There are no clear data points showing that the \[inventory\] restocking schedule will begin anytime soon, so it does not seem that a recovery will result from near-term growth in demand.

“At the same time, carrier capacity management has not been sufficient. Scrapping is negligible. Idling remains low. Excess supply seems to be here to stay for a while, reducing optimism that rates will recover.”

.....

lol. This is gold to my squeeze ears and provocative, it's like calling bottom, and telling everyone please short me. Any slightly positive ER zim gives given this terrible guidance will not be priced in.

Given this exit of long term dividend investors and trash guidance would expect shorts to pile. They did but not to degree of the past. Per my poorly placed screenshot (at the top) you can see the spike in borrow rate not as large as before, these I call the suckers. You can't short on bad news that's not a market edge bro that's a trap.

Lets transport to current day

Looks like they are ahead of schedule for guidance and issueing the first dividend since 2022 (guess the foreseable future is now lol). Ex div date is June 4 around then i plan on exiting short term calls.

Also its been a controlled exit but for shorts they decreased SI by almost 50% w/o rocketing the stock

Amazing but still more work to be done. Now look at the industry... just straight running ...

This is DAC they use to own a good amount zim stock back in the day  stock they running.

Now look at container rates....

breaking out last time they were this high was around $40/sh and articles expect container rates to run throughout june. (source https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/23/a-sudden-container-crunch-is-sending-ocean-freight-rates-soaring.html) THe mkt is forward looking so price of shipping stocks run in advance of this expecation as is happening now.

(seems kinda ominous lol!)

tldr the CEO sandbagged er end of 2023, he couldn't see a scenario in which zim made money in the near future, so shorts entered hard. But according to Mr Nielson the market conditions now defy all expecations from 6-9months ago. Since apirl shorts have been existing hard the price has been controled only a 10% move each day, but a confluence of factors make exiting rn imperiative including the announcment of a dividend which must be paid by people who borrow stocks. Thus i think $ZIM will run hard af into ex-dividend date and could have a uncontrolled price day

So jump on the train for this shitco!! Come join me in the ether and sniff this glue, get woken up on the other side with narcane, and be a free thinker",LABEL_0

2024-05-27 17:44:37,When will Leith drop Vinfast?,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/VinFastComm/comments/1d1uisx/when_will_leith_drop_vinfast/,"Leith is the flagship of Vinfast dealers: it is the first one and it is in North Carolina, home of Vinfast ""fake"" factory, and further, it is only few minutes from Van Anh Nguyen's home.

However, I spot something perculiar going on at Leith:

1/ The frequency of Leith Vinfast [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LeithVinFast/) posts getting longer. Lastest one on May 24 and the one before is April 26, nearly a month earlier. Usually, the marketing team at Leith Vinfast timed about 20 days at most to post a new post, and it was much more frequently in Jan and Feb. Here are the dates: May 24, April 19, April 9, April 4, March 31, March 7, March 5, Feb 29, Feb 24, Feb 23, Feb 17, Feb 2, Feb 1, Jan 28, Jan 25, Jan 19, Jan 18, Jan 16, Jan 13, Jan 11, Jan 5, Dec 29, Dec 28, Dec 19 (start date).

2/ More telling: the post about the new $299/mo lease for VF8 appeared on May 24 while this policy was enacted 22 days ago. This is very telling: Leith Vinfast should advertise the $299/mo lease on Facebook right when that policy came out a few weeks before but it did not. Leith Vinfast is losing interest in Vinfast.

3/ Leith Vinfast only sold 9 cars so far in May 2024. Here:

https://preview.redd.it/f617shpzoz2d1.png?width=469&format=png&auto=webp&s=dea578437ec92499b7d5875049aeea9813dbf0da

4/ No post about VF3.

5/ No post about VF9 since it was imported to the US

6/ Leith Vinfast Instagram account was deleted: [https://www.instagram.com/leithvinfast/](https://www.instagram.com/leithvinfast/)

Leith Vinfast, the flagship dealer among all Vinfast dealers, is losing interest in Vinfast. It sold just 9 Vinfast in May so far (before, it was about 40 a month with the promo $249/mo, still tiny but obviously 4 times more than now). VF8 is becoming less and less competitive with price cut from competitors, especially Tesla, Kia, and Hyundai.

So I will go out on a limb to predict that

1/ $249/mo and then $199/mo coming, a huge loss for Vinfast.

2/ Leith will drop Vinfast before 12/31/2024 as the sale is too low and the margin is too thin, not to say all the bad public relation with the three lawsuits.",LABEL_1

2024-05-27 12:40:21,Watkin jones (LSE:WJG): 100 year old house builder in UK ,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1d1on06/watkin_jones_lsewjg_100_year_old_house_builder_in/,"Warning: This is a long write-up because it's complex but once you understand it I think it's pretty clearly undervalued.

Watkin Jones was founded in 1791! A very old company.

Excerpt from their website:

>The Watkin Jones' first family business was founded in Bangor, North Wales in 1791. Starting out in carpentry, the business later moved into building and construction. Now known as Watkin Jones plc, the company was at the heart of the growth of the local area, even laying the first stone of the new Bangor University College Buildings. Watkin Jones plc moved into the residential sector in the 1920s, building private homes in North Wales, before expanding in the 1990s with a new homes division.

>In 1999, Watkin Jones plc completed its first student accommodation development and, following the 2008 financial crisis, the company went from strength to strength. The business transformed from a regional developer to a national name in student accommodation, before floating on the London Stock Exchange in 2016. The Watkin Jones family exited the businesses in 2018 to concentrate on Watkin Property Ventures but remain minority shareholders.

So the modern Watkin Jones company that we know today really started from 1999 with the switch from residential to student accommodation.

This still makes up nearly 50% of their revenue as seen here:

The second biggest slice of revenue belongs to the BTR (build-to-rent) category which they are focusing on more for the future and will become a bigger slive of revenue % in the coming years I predict.

BTR is a fairly new thing in the UK where it was first done in 2012. You can read more about BTR here:

[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/essentials-build-rent-uk-theupperkey-ovike#:\~:text=The%20History%20of%20Build%20To,in%20the%20property%20investment%20sector](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/essentials-build-rent-uk-theupperkey-ovike#:~:text=The%20History%20of%20Build%20To,in%20the%20property%20investment%20sector)

There are a few different ways of funding doing BTR's, watkin jones uses the forward funding financing type, here's forward funding explained (using chatgpt help for this part):

>Forward funding for BTR is a financing approach where an investor or fund (legal and general, grainger plc etc) agrees to provide capital for the entire development project, not just the land. This involves purchasing the land and committing to finance the construction of the property. The process usually unfolds as follows:

>Pre-Development Agreement: The investor or fund enters into an agreement with the developer before the commencement of the project. This agreement outlines the terms, including the purchase of the land and the provision of funds for the development.

>Land Acquisition: The investor or fund purchases the land from the developer or a third party, securing the location for the development.

>Development Funding: The investor or fund provides the necessary capital to the developer to finance the construction of the project. This can cover various costs, including materials, labor, and other expenses related to the development.

>Project Completion: Once the development is complete, the property is handed over to the investor or fund. The developer earns a profit based on the pre-agreed terms for their role in completing the project.

>Rental Operations: The investor or fund then takes over the property, managing it as a rental asset to generate income.

This approach has a big benefit, it allows immediate cash flow immediately for the developer to begin building. This means they don't build it and are then stuck with an expensive building they can't sell and have to manage themselves which is a different industry.

This is why their stock price was trading at £2.4 in 2019, investors liked this model and the big cash flows that came up front and presumed it was all de-risked.

However, their is a HUGE risk with this type of financing that investors overlooked called cost build inflation and fast interest rate spikes, if inflation rises quickly in a short period of time (like 2022) then the cost of building the sites skyrockets and the developers margins go down the drain because they have already signed the contract with the investor to sell it at a pre-agreed price (note: i have no idea if they have provisions in the contracts to de-risk inflation or not, presumably they didn't but should do going forward given the risk).

Also the side-effect of interest rates rising rapidly means that institutional investors now have no appetite for BTR's because the property valuations dropped and the cost of financing debt rose a lot which makes them taking on debt to finance these purchases a lot less attractive (note: this is slightly offset by rents rising at a rapid pace and improving yield % on the properties). This meant that institutional investors stopped purchasing BTR's from Watkin Jones and started buying 4% UK government bonds.

The forward funding market 'dried up' (due to the large cost of financing debt now) and that also hurt them.

There's also another huge issue which hurts watkin jones and that's cladding provisions. In 2016 their was a huge fire in Grenfell which was caused by poor fire safety cladding in the walls. Since then all properties over x amount of floors have to be checked by law to have proper cladding in the walls, and if they fail that check then they have to replace the cladding or abandon it/tear it down. This is a hugely expensive process and in 2022 the government made developers such as WatkinJones even more responsible for this.

This has resulted in £30m provisions for fire cladding initially being recognized on their balance sheet in 2022 and being upped to a total of £66m in 2023 (£11m in reimbursement means a net provision of £55m). This provision still has material uncertainty around it given that it seems hard for watkin jones to tell how many properties are affected or not and the expanded scope of legisliation in 2022. This provision will mean £60m cash flow is reduced over the next 5 years from WJG free cash flow and spent on maintenance CAPEX on this.

Page 24:

[https://watkinjonesplc.com/media/2bqdqf3i/watkin-jones-group-plc-fy23-results-final.pdf](https://watkinjonesplc.com/media/2bqdqf3i/watkin-jones-group-plc-fy23-results-final.pdf)

>After 2020, Watkin Jones added a £15m\~ provision for 15 properties. This was based on the initial 12 year contractual period  (from 2008) for the following:

>

>2) Buildings above 18m in height that featured high pressure laminate (‘HPL’).

In Jan. 2022, more responsibility was put on homebuilders by the government with the 2022 BSA act:

i) extend the scope of developers’ responsibility to 30 years;

ii) increase the scope by including buildings above 11 metres; and

iii) expand the scope to incorporate life critical safety defects.

The issue is that homebuilders do not take records of apartments outside of the 12 year contract period. And this is where estimations come in as they have to do surveys of every building.

Watkin jones made a further £30m provision for these costs related to 18 additional apartment blocks.

Then in Sep. 2023, secondary legislation (called RAS) was passed which mostly affects leashold buildings, WatkinJones only has 13 leasehold buildings (as BTR and PBSA are different) and 5 of these buildings were further added to the provision.

One key thing from here:

>However, as set out above, the RAS does not specifically apply to PBSA and BTR properties, noting that the overall objective of the government policy was to protect individual leaseholders in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire

So if the government does more legislation then this will hurt WJG further.

There's also a 4% additional tax charge on big homebuilders profits over £25m and a new building safety levy on most buildings (50% discount on brownfields), this cost should be passed on by developers by reducing the amount they pay for the land they purchase. However it will hurt watkin jones near-term margins by 100bps around probably due to margin supression as they have an existing land bank of £100m\~ to go through that they bought when the levy didn't exist.

**Why is it undervalued then?**

BTR is here to stay in the UK in my opinion, the costs from cladding will be passed on to the consumer.

[https://propertyindustryeye.com/big-increase-in-value-of-uks-build-to-rent-sector-predicted/](https://propertyindustryeye.com/big-increase-in-value-of-uks-build-to-rent-sector-predicted/)

It will grow rapidly once interest rates come down and the forward funding market comes back (the UK is projected to slash interest rates 3 times by end of 2024). I personally live in a BTR myself and I can tell you right now that it is FAR superior for upper-middle class and international students than normal private landlords, the quality of the build, the amenities like onsite supermarket, gym, cinema room, co-working space, rooftops, 24 hr concierge is really great.

It costs like 30-50% more than the equivalent non BTR but you get what you pay for. The ratings on BTR's by renters are very high. See for yourself here on one of the property managers sites: [https://modaliving.com/](https://modaliving.com/)

Institutions have liked BTR's (before the interest spikes) because they have a higher yield %, clients are more likely to pay on time (due to being more affluent) and stay for longer because they like the quality and amenities.

BTR builds in progress have fallen after interest rate spikes (you can read about it here from one of the clients: https://corporate.graingerplc.co.uk/sites/graingerplc-corp/files/2023-11/grainger-ara23-23-11-21.pdf), combined with the recent rent yield spikes, this should provide a good market imbalance in supply/demand was interest rates fall in watkin jones favour in the coming years.

Student accommodation has a serious under-supply, not all students can get accommodation guaranteed when going to university. International students fuel a lot of the demand as well.

See here:

>New analysis of the PBSA sector from Savills shows that shortfalls in student accommodation mean that the UK needs 234,000 extra beds to reach 1.5 full-time students per bed. London has the largest need for student accommodation, with almost 100,000 beds required to make up the shortfall

This sector is obviously heavily tied to university student numbers. Projected HE students in UK:

This should provide a secular tailwind that means Univesities will continue to demand student accommodation.

Note: This projection is subject to change depending on government policies, see here for example : [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd11xy2g5elo](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd11xy2g5elo)

Rishi Sunak recently backtracked on a tougher crackdown on student visa regulations but it's still a risk.

**Competitors**:

Competitors aren't really a big thing in this market as a risk. It's not like a new tech company can come in and up root the industry. It was also very hard to actually find other builders that focus on BTR, student accommodation so I can't give much infomation here. The only real one I could find was Grainger PLC who is more of an investor in BTR's.

See page 25 of their 2019 AR for more detail.

**Risks**:

* Fire safety cladding provision could be increased again, reducing free cash flow and margins potentially. If this happens and WJG bear case happens then it could also mean they breach their debt covenants (as they say in their FY23) although this is unlikely.
* WJG recognises revenue and profit as they progress through the build (AFAIK) so this requires some estimations until completion, so there's more accounting risk in this company as it's easier to fake numbers by management when estimations are possible.
* Inflation doesn't go down or spikes again = prolonged pain for watkin jones as they won't be able to sell properties. This inflation spike has exposed the weakness in WJG business model and why it was most risky when it was actually at £2.4 a share.
* Interest rates don't go down for whatever reason such as the unlikely case the UK goes through an economic boom like the US (unlikely).

**My DCF & Notes**:

Homebuilders have a unlevered beta of 0.97, I gave WJG an unlevered beta of 1.37 to reflect new risks around legislation in the UK on an ongoing basis, this is just essentially guessing though as betas are already really hard to do. This results in a WACC of 12%.

I've taken into account the new building levy (by reducing near term margins on WJG existing land banks), new 4% homebuilders tax, provision cladding (by reducing FCFF).

They are highlighted in yellow mostly.

The above assumption presumes that WJG normalises at a lower EBIT margin than historical due to new legislation of 12% (historical was 16%+) with a new higher tax rate.

I did a reverse DCF as well and I really cannot arrive at the 50p the market is pricing WJG at, for this scenario to happen, you would need a huge margin deterioration terminally of like 7% with no or terminally declining growth and an increased provision in cladding.

Here you can see a reverse DCF:

https://preview.redd.it/zay7na076y2d1.png?width=2362&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1fdb67143e7fb77ca3b845156c4371e84129f0d

I increased provision to 100 from 55, did 0% growth and 7% oper. margins which also results in a much lower ROIC.

That's what the market is pricing in, I don't see how you can expect margins to be so low and growth to be 0% like this when BTR and PBSA are growing med-long term. Makes no sense. 7% margins is only 3.5% above where they are right now in FY23 and that doesn't add up because margins in this year have been killed by inflation, rates and the forward funding market stopping.

Any risks on increased cladding don't really affect the DCF too much as long as WJG stays solvent within debt covenants (they should they have a good balance sheet).

Thoughts? WJG is my biggest holding at 16% of portfolio now.

Directors have been buying at around the same price in 2023 as well.

2024-05-27 08:08:31,Goldbacks Are Stackable Investments,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Goldback/comments/1d1kwe9/goldbacks_are_stackable_investments/,"I often see people saying Goldbacks ""aren't good for stacking"" or are ""not good as an investment"" vs. other fractional gold. These sentiments miss the mark. The Goldback's role as a superior and growing form of transactional gold (sound money) is well-covered elsewhere; My thoughts here are about the Goldback independent of, but complimentary to that role.

Like any other bullion product, the price of Goldbacks moves with the price of gold. More than any other fractional, they can be stacked with pocket money. Accumulated over time, if desired once the stack is big enough, they are easily moved to a less-useful longer-term heavier product for deep stacking ***without loss of the ""premium""*** because...

Goldbacks are predictably and reliably liquid. No matter the local environment, there is *at least* one market maker; In a Goldback state, owners can walk into Alpine Gold and exchange held Goldbacks back to fiat for a 5% spread off the daily sell price. If not in a Goldback state, they can be redeemed by mail to Alpine Gold for the same 5% spread. The value over melt is not ""lost"" as you move in and out of Goldbacks like it is with fractional coins and bars. In fact, the predictability and market confidence provided by this service is part of what the ""premium"" pays for.

Relying on an LCS as a liquidity partner is in my experience neither predictable, nor confidence inspiring. Premiums and buy/sell spreads are variable, negotiable, and even capricious. YMMV, of course, but that's kinda my point. Using a non-local resource that offers predictable published buy prices and reliable service - if such a thing is found - could offer fractional liquidity similar to Goldbacks...but spreads on fractional are usually **far** higher than 5%.

As investments not held physically, Goldbacks vaulted via the UPMA can be traded with a 0% spread, and earn a 2% - 3.5% lease return on assets held long-term.

So for as long as Goldback Inc., Alpine Gold, and UPMA exist, I argue that the Goldback is *more* stackable and investable than other fractional gold.

If Goldback, Inc. falters and disappears, then the Goldback stack becomes harder to liquidate. Should this happen suddenly without time to take action, the value of the stack could potentially (though not likely) fall to melt. Like any **investment**, there are risks involved that should be studied, and this is definitely a risk worth considering. My assessment at this time is that Goldback Inc. is in a growth position, and looks to be competently run. The currency ecosystem that Goldback Inc. is building is on sound footing, making failure risk non-zero but low. It's not illegitimate to feel otherwise, but I see Goldback Inc. on the upswing, and don't see trivial liquidity of the Goldback becoming an issue any time soon.

However, if ""Just In Case"" happens, then the stack reverts solely to Goldback's raison d'être, which is it's superior role as a form of barterable sound money. In this case the utility value of portable, fungible, recognizable, fake-free fractional gold currency remains. Having them amongst the stack is therefore a Good Thing™.

Since learning of Goldbacks I've bought 'em, collected 'em, stacked 'em, sold 'em, and invested 'em. (For ROI over this short time, Goldbacks are actually my best performing **investment**!) About the only thing I *haven't* done yet is spend them. I'm eager to do that and I see it coming, but being far from any Goldback state this is more of an aspirational thing…for now.

PSA before we get started – I’m probably going to struggle to keep my Sunday release schedule across the next few months. I’ve got holidays and a house move in the pipeline, so my free time is going to be dipping a significant amount. I’ll still be posting, but don’t freak out if these start coming out on a Monday/Tuesday for a bit. Sunday is always the aim though so once everything’s sorted I’ll be back to my regular schedule.

As always, scroll down for **UFC 302 Breakdowns.** The following is just a recap of last event’s results.

**\~UFC Vegas 92 (PREVIOUS CARD)\~**

Staked: **16.25u**

Profit/Loss: **-4.87u**

Parlay Suggestions: **3-2**

After landing two great underdog bets on Bellator, I watch my -120 bet on Piera Rodriguez (who closed at -225 FFS) end via the lowest bit of IQ I’ve ever seen…and I knew it was all going downhill from there. Combine that with another bad beat submission being fully locked up at the end of a round (that’s happened at least three times to me this year), and it very easily could have been a winning event. COULD.

It does need to be said though that I’m really grateful for the positive messages I’ve received in the last few weeks. My bets may be atrocious lately, but it seems people are still finding value in my insight and summaries of what to expect from these fights. So as long as you’re not paying too much attention to who I am betting, there might still be some point to reading this! Maybe even to see who I’m betting so you can fade me and back the other side!

 

**\~UFC 302\~**

I still think the cards are suffering from 299 and 300 being so star studded…because this card is definitely missing something. The main event is huge, sure…but Randy Brown vs Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos isn’t really a main card calibre fight in my opinion. Either way, it’s better than the Apex so I don’t even care.

Let’s get into it!

 

**\~Islam Makhachev v Dustin Poirier\~**

Dustin Poirier’s win against Benoit St. Denis makes this one a whole lot more interesting. We’d seen him get clearly outgrappled by the likes of Khabib and Charles Oliveira before, where his overall grappling defence eventually crumbled and he found himself submitted…but things felt significantly improved against BSD. The Frenchman may be much less experienced and more aggressive/sloppy than the two aforementioned former champions, but Poirier had to fight through some tricky moments to make it to the later rounds in the first place. If he has in fact made improvements, this fight against Islam Makhachev is much more interesting than we would have expected a year ago.

That’s not to say that Makhachev is directly comparable to BSD, or even Khabib. The 155lbs champion is much more comfortable on the feet than those two, and won’t be a fish out of water at distance. That’s a key part to this fight, as the uncomfortableness of a wrestler is what forces them shoot sloppy takedown entries and ultimately gas out. Personally, I think this is what makes Makhachev better than Khabib, as he showed no issue with striking with both Volk and Charles. Both are clearly inferior to Dustin, of course…but I’m just saying that he doesn’t have to necessarily act like the standup is lava.

Anyway, Dustin is still a very dangerous fighter. He can absolutely still catch Makhachev on the feet, and he could even catch that stupid banter guillotine that he keeps going for. But I think it’s still unlikely that he does. Islam is so skilled and blending the martial arts together, his cardio is on point, and defensively he’s been class aside from that one fight against Martins. Also, that ‘jump the guilly’ narrative is not good for Dustin at all, and I would genuinely be grateful every time he attempts it if I was Islam.

Stylistics and fight analysis aside, Makhachev sits at -450 (82%) here at the betting window. In terms of his chances of winning, he absolutely deserves to be a significant favourite, but the sheer fact that Poirier’s path to victory almost exclusively needs to come from one moment of brilliance, as well as the fact he seems to have shown significant improvements…it just doesn’t make that -450 appealing at all.

So do you bet Dustin on the return? If you’re someone who likes to have a bet on every fight then I think it’s objectively a good roll of the dice, but you should realise that bet will lose more often than it wins so it’s certainly a risky one. I’d say it’s value, but given my recent history it’s not a bet I’m willing to place myself.

It’s a massive fight, but it’s no bet from me. Islam could win on the scorecards, or by KO or Submission, so I don’t really think I see any clear prop to want to target either. A roll of the dice on Dustin ITD is probably the only play I’d recommend here, but I’m not betting it myself. I’m obviously picking Makhachev to win though.

**How I line this fight:** Islam Makhachev -250 (75%), Dustin Poirier +250 (25%)

**Bet or pass:** Pass

**Prop leans:** None

 

**\~Sean Strickland v Paul Costa\~**

This one should be a lot of fun. It’s a bit of a silly fight between two of the UFC’s best memelords, but it doesn’t really make a whole lot of sense for the rankings. Not that that really seems to matter anymore. It makes even less sense that it’s 25 minutes as well. But the UFC just do what the hell they want these days.

I think this fight is pretty binary (not sure if Sean would be comfortable competing if it wasn’t!). Costa’s the hard hitter that will probably slow down in the non-title-championship rounds, whilst Strickland and his persistent jab will be happy to go 25 minutes.

So does Costa get Strickland out of there early? Maybe. We’ve seen Sean struggle with hard hitters that look to put him on the backfoot early (Pereira and Abus most recently), so Costa will definitely have his chances in the opening round against the low guard and occasional defensive lapses.

But overall I just feel like this is Strickland’s fight to lose. He’s shown that he has what it takes to go a hard 25, and his straight shots and very reliable high volume should be enough for rounds 3/4/5 to be clearly in his favour. Relying on the early finish isn’t really a particularly confident and highly replicated path, as Costa himself has shown us in recent years – having not finished any of his last five fights, including a very favourable fight against a chinny Luke Rockhold.

Therefore, Sean deserves to be a favourite on the moneyline, almost entirely because this one is a 25-minute affair and he should be styling on his Brazilian opponent by rounds 4 and 5. Strickland currently sits at -225 at the time of writing, which seems mostly accurate. There’s going to be some sketchy moments though, and a loss for that bet can come in the blink of an eye…so I don’t think there’s any meat on the bone to force a play here. I’ll take a look at Strickland 4, 5 or by Decision but unless it’s plus money I wouldn’t get involved.

I’m interested to see where the totals end up for this fight, given that the moneyline is dictated so much by how long the fight lasts. In fact, there’s a possibility that a bet on the totals could be a smarter alternative to betting the moneyline entirely. I doubt they’ll get caught out, but I’ll be keeping an eye out anyway.

Well damn, Strickland 4, 5 or Decision was available to me at +175, so I absolutely took it. That should be close to his money line, as far as I'm concerned.

**How I line this fight:** Sean Strickland -200 (66%), Paulo Costa +200 (33%)

**Bet or pass:** 2u Strickland to Win in R4, 5 or by Decision (+175) 

**Prop leans:** See above

**Live Betting Leans:** A live bet on Strickland is possibly the best entry point for this fight…if he loses R1/2 you could be in with the chance of taking a bigger number on his moneyline and hoping he turns it around in the final three rounds.

 

**\~Kevin Holland v Michal Oleksiejczuk\~**

This is a very fun fight, and it’s nice to see Michal getting a main card opportunity on a PPV…even if it is a tricky matchup for him. He’s always been one of my favourite fighters because his style always makes fights strategic and tactical, and when he’s doing his best work he has some of the best hands in the UFC.

Lord Michal is a pretty basic fighter to break down because he’s very one-dimensional. He’s kind of caught in no-man’s land between Middleweight and Welterweight, opting to fight at the former weight class despite being pretty criminally undersized. The upside to that is that the Polish fighter can weaponise his speed whilst also benefitting from some more power, which goes very nicely with his pocket-boxing based style. Oleksiejczuk is all about pressure and fighting in the phone booth, and he has some of the best body work in the UFC today. Outside of pure striking, Oleksiejczuk shows his one-dimensional tendencies by being pretty awful in the grappling realm…which is where his lack of size at Middleweight comes back to haunt him.

Kevin Holland is a fighter that I’ve been pretty antagonistic towards since I’ve been writing on Reddit. I saw his potential right away when he joined the UFC, and bet him at reasonable prices against fighters he was clearly better than, or otherwise I bet his submission prop against fighters he was clearly superior to on the mat. He made me sweat when it took him three rounds to submit John Phillips, he made me sweat when he went to a split with GM3, he made me sweat when he went to a split with Darren Stewart. You can see where the resentment comes from. In short, my conclusion on Holland is that he is possibly the hardest fighter to trust on the roster, because he likes to fuck around inside the cage, and he can also obviously get stuck on his back.

However, I think this fight presents an opportunity for Holland to put on a great performance, because neither of those limitations should hold him back here. Lord Michal will be looking to engage with him and produce a high enough work rate that it will keep Holland active, which hopefully prevents him from taunting and chatting shit when he should be throwing strikes. Also, Michal won’t want to wrestle, and Holland would have all the answers if he even tried. So this is one of the rare fights where I think I can trust Holland not to be his own worst enemy.

This one’s going to play out almost exclusively on the feet unless Holland wants it any different, and I expect Big Mouth’s seven inch reach advantage to play a very significant part here. Michal will be getting tagged at a high clip in this fight, and those visuals don’t sit well from a round winning perspective. Furthermore, that kind of style is one that does tax Michal’s cardio, so I would expect Holland to grow into the fight the longer it lasts anyway. Of course, the lanky frame of Holland, as well as his diverse arsenal of knees in the clinch, will likely give him the advantage should he opt to clinch with Michal…which works as a very nice counter to the range that Michal is going to want to sit in. From there, Holland may even be able to set up some sort of front choke, or even blow everyone’s minds and look for a takedown himself (don’t rely on that, Holland cannot be trusted to take that path).

In short, I think Kevin Holland has all the tools to show his superiority in every aspect of the fight, he just needs to manage distance and not spend time swinging hooks in close with Oleksiejczuk. The prospect of trusting Kevin Holland (let alone at this price) is something that does not sit well with me, but I was honestly expecting him to be around -300 here. Also, as a smaller point, I’d expect Holland to have a chip on his shoulder after the embarrassing loss to MVP. I imagine getting schooled like that by a newcomer that’s gone and stolen a lot of his shine will likely hurt Holland, so he'll hopefully be looking to come back and make a statement (but who am I to predict the mentality of a cage fighter?)

Regardless, This is a fight where the minute winning, cardio, experience, durability, finishing potential, clinch and grappling upside all sit with Kevin Holland, so I expect to see him get his hand raised. At -225, I was happy to use him as a parlay piece.

**How I line this fight:** Kevin Holland -300 (75%), Michal Oleksiejczuk +300 (25%)

**Bet or pass:** 2u Kevin Holland and Grant Dawson both to Win (+110)

**Prop leans:** Holland ITD is always live, but he likes to showboat and play with his food too much for me to trust that.

 

**\~Jailton Almeida v Alexandr Romanov\~**

This is a very interesting but weird fight. Despite having recently taken his first L (which I successfully bet on, even though it didn’t play out as predicted), I still think there are some serious questions surrounding Jailton Almeida. He was looking good in the opening round against Blaydes, landing nine takedowns on potentially the division’s best wrestler. He couldn’t really secure a dominant position on Blaydes, but he was clearly in control as long as he could have kept it up for 15 minutes. Then, early in round two…he fell victim to Donkey Kong punches against the cage whilst in a single leg entry. Unsure whether there’s a point to be made about the chin of Almeida there, or not. Weird, low percentage finish.

So that’s a serious lesson that Almeida needs to respect his opponents a bit more, but honestly we saw more good than bad from Jailton in that fight. The takedowns were definitely there, as was his ability to chain them together with mat returns. Also, his striking, whilst still a bit awkward and rigid, looks to be improving, and he didn’t look as inferior to Blaydes as I was anticipating. Against Alexander Romanov here, I think it’s fair to say that Almeida doesn’t need to panic if he’s on the feet…and could probably stay there if he wanted to.

Alexandr Romanov has been one of the most entertaining circus freaks in recent years of Heavyweight MMA. I did a tonne of research into his regional career for his original debut against Marcin Tybura, where I concluded that he was a hilarious meme fighter that was feasting on some obese kebab shop locals…winning multiple fights via a fucking forearm choke as he smothered opponents with his belly. He got to the UFC and did the same ridiculous stuff, but he actually managed to do it against slightly more credible opposition (Juan Espino, Marcos Rogerio de Lima, and Blagoy Ivanov).

The most frustrating thing about Blaydes vs Almeida was that Curtis didn’t try nor manage to find any top control of his own. The big question marks about Jailton, especially in this fight, are how he handles takedown attempts and being on bottom. He’s obviously a high level grappler, but Heavyweight MMA is different kettle of fish where get ups are naturally more difficult to achieve (due to the weight on top of you, the bigger frames, and less speed/explosiveness…and the fact that most of the division look like oil barrels). Also, the limits to dexterity and flexibility mean that submissions from bottom are very rare at 265lbs. When was the last armbar or triangle choke from guard at 265lbs? Massive kudos to anyone who can actually answer that.

So basically, I think it’s impossible to know how much of a chance Alexandr Romanov has to win this fight. Should he attempt a takedown, he will be the second man behind Derrick fucking Lewis to have tried to force Jailton to the floor (which speaks to how little we know). From there, he may face a Swiss Army Knife’s equivalent of a BJJ guard, or perhaps a fighter that’s just content to lay on their back for the entire round and do sweet fuck all.

In short, I think Romanov could look anywhere from +500 to -500 in hindsight. It’s obviously unlikely to be the latter, but I cannot rule it out having seen nothing of Jailton’s defensive grappling capabilities. Chuck in some smaller intangibles surrounding Jailton returning after his first professional loss (specifically by KO), and it’s a very easy pass for me. I still expect Jailton to win, but betting the moneyline at this number is out of the question.

**How I line this fight:** Jailton Almeida -200 (67%), Alexandr Romanov +200 (33%)

**Bet or pass:** Pass

**Prop leans:** None

 

**\~Randy Brown v Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos\~**

You guys know I love betting on Randy Brown, but I think this is a bit of a tough matchup to be overly confident in him.

Randy is usually the more well-rounded fighter and can threaten opponents with both his striking and submissions…but he’s going up against an opponent in Elizeu Zaleski that is potentially more dangerous in those areas.

If Randy wins this I think he’s going to have to use movement and straight shots to pick his way to a decision. A do-able task, but a scary one when you consider he over-uses his head movement and under-uses traditional striking defence. I just know that anyone backing Brown is going to be clenching hard during literally every striking exchange (trust me I’ve been there)…so I don’t think I could see myself backing him here at all, especially not as a favourite. He does have a bit of power, but I think the recent KO over the old and significantly slower Muslim Salikhov possibly flatters his overall capabilities of ending fights with his hands (his last KO win came nine fights prior, and before that we’re all the way back in 2016). His submissions have been much more potent, but EZDS has been a competent anti-grappler in his UFC career (including most recently against a very decent grappler in Rinat Fakhretdinov). So I don’t see that as a super reliable path for him either.

Zaleski’s a very powerful guy, with a lot of similarities to fellow Brazilian Vicente Luque in the way he approaches things on the feet. He’ll walk forward and throw bombs, which sometimes isn’t the smartest way to fight when he gets into a barnburner, but I think that’ll be fine when he’s got the superior firepower here.

Randy Brown is going to have a five-inch reach advantage and is the younger fighter here, which are likely the most prominent factors in explaining why he’s the favourite here (along with recency bias from the Salikhov finish). Whilst I can understand the arguments that may see Brown given the slight respect into favouritism, I think his path to victory relies on a near-perfect 15 minutes where he has to stick and move, whilst Zaleski needs one punch on the return.

I played the Brazilian for 1u here at +130, and unfortunately the line actually got better afterwards. Not often that happens, but oh well. Not going to add more.

**How I line this fight:** Randy Brown +100 (50%), Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos +100

**Bet or pass:** 1u Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos to Win (+130)

**Prop leans:** See above

 

**\~Cesar Almeida v Roman Kopylov\~**

Another interesting fight where I’ve bet the underdog.

I rate Roman Kopylov as a striker, but I do think there needs to be a bit of an asterisk on what we’ve seen in the UFC so far. His highlight reel striking performances have come against Alessio Di Chirico, Punahele Soriano, Claudio Ribeiro, and Josh Fremd. I’m not saying those guys are bad, but they’re pretty flawed strikers that haven’t really been able to make a splash in the UFC with those assets alone. The best striker he’s faced in the UFC so far came all the way back in his debut against Karl Roberson, where he was second best.

Yes Cesar Almeida is only 5-0, but I think we saw enough in his UFC debut to show that he’s got capable enough defensive abilities to allow his kickboxing background to shine. Similar to Pereira when he came into the UFC. You can very clearly see the difference between him and the likes of Despaigne, who was a fish out of water as soon as things hit the mat (shoutout to Cortes-Acosta for the fight IQ there, I respect it). Regardless of that, Kopylov couldn’t even outgrapple Karl Roberson so I don’t expect this one to be decided via grappling anyway.

I’ve not gone back and watched a whole lot of tape for this one, it’s honestly just a narrative bet on credentials and capitalising on MMA striking being vastly overblown. When you consider the success that a lot of these kickboxers-turned-MMA fighters have in pure striking bouts, you eventually come to realise that MMA striking is vastly inferior – Izzy and Alex Pereira’s careers pretty much tell us this.

So as long as Kopylov doesn’t show serious sneaky improvements to his grappling, I think the line is the wrong way around here. Almeida could look anything from +100 to -300 in a striking-based fight, so at +125 I had to pull the trigger. Usually I don’t like to bet on narratives and without tape, but it’s not like me slaving away over footage has been particularly useful to me in recent months lol.

**How I line this fight:** Cesar Almeida -150 (60%), Roman Kopylov +150 (40%)

**Bet or pass:** 2u Cesar Almeida to Win (+125)

**Prop leans:** None

 

**\~Grant Dawson v Joe Solecki\~**

Third bet in a row here! Personally I think this is a pretty disrespectful line towards Dawson, who was very much looking like a top 15 kind of guy before he got put to sleep by Bobby Green. Obviously Bobby hit his path to victory there, but that result was a bit of an anomaly in my opinion. We’ve not seen Dawson show bad chin issues in the past, and Green isn’t really a one-and-done kind of hitter. Whether or not Dawson would have gone on to struggle against Green anyway across a longer distance fight I don’t know, but I’m not really lowering my opinion of Dawson as a result of the loss. It’s an overused example for a comparison, but remember that main eventer and P4P #1 Islam Makhachev once got KO’d very early in a UFC bout, and that didn’t stop him from demonstrating every bit of potential we thought he had before that result.

So how does this bout against Joe Solecki look? Well it’s clearly going to be a grappling-based fight, which kind of makes the concerns about Dawson’s recent KO loss even less relevant. Solecki is a guy I rate the grappling ability of, but in bouts like this I’ll often refer to how the wrestling and ability to maintain top control also plays a part…and that’s why I’m betting on Grant Dawson here.

Solecki may be the superior guy were they to compete in BJJ, but in an MMA context I just don’t think he’s going to be good enough to consistently get the better of Dawson in wrestling exchanges, nor keep him grounded for long enough should he end up on top. Solecki’s best work is done when he’s found a way to take the back, but I just can’t see Dawson being on the defensive enough here to find himself defending an RNC.

We have seen Dawson compete in grappling-focused UFC bouts against Damir Ismagulov, Mark Madsen, Jared Gordon, Rick Glenn, Leo Santos back-to-back, and he confidently won every fight except the Glenn one (where he very weirdly gassed out in the third and got 10-8’d.) Aside from that, he scored finishes in three of those fights, and scored x2 10-8 rounds against Ismagulov. High level stuff against some impressive names in their craft.

Solecki, on the other hand recently suffered a loss via low percentage means against Klose, so we won’t critique him for that. Prior to that, he lost a decision to the aforementioned Jared Gordon when his grappling failed him in the latter half of the fight. He also lost the opening round to Jim Miller, when Jim was very much a R1 only kind of guy (early after the Lymes disease diagnosis). Not shockingly bad results, but enough to give us an understanding of where his completely grappling game stacks up compared to the rest of the divison. IE, not on Dawson’s level.

In short, Solecki is one dimensional, and because of his lack of diversity in his abilities, I think it’s highly unlikely he finds the opportunities to show off the one-dimension he has. Dawson on the other hand, will have more top control and pressure, and his ground striking should clearly separate him as the round winner. He will need to be careful of the submissions, sweeps and reversals from Solecki, but I think Dawson’s proven himself enough against grapplers in the UFC so far for him to be trusted here. I combined him with Kevin Holland at -250 for a +110 parlay for 2u.

**How I line this fight:** Grant Dawson -400 (80%), Joe Solecki (20%)

**Bet or pass:** 2u Grant Dawson + Kevin Holland both to Win (+110)

**Prop leans:** None

 

**\~Niko Price v Alex Morono\~**

Niko Price is a fighter I usually have very little interest in betting, because he is reliably unreliable. So many of his UFC wins are forged in the fire, where a heavy strike that Price has thrown is just a split second quicker than the equally dangerous attack of his opponent…and the exact same could be said for his losses. More recently he’s also been on a pretty terrible run of form, getting finished by old man Robbie Lawler (nice tip on Lawler KO from me there!), as well as Phil Rowe. In fact, Price’s entire record since 2018 is full of asterisks and reasons to doubt him. His wins are all super high variance (two KO wins from off his back is WILD), or against very old and shopworn opponents. Basically, I don’t think you could trust him with much.

Alex Morono on the other hand, is a fighter who has mostly trended upwards in his UFC career. I say it every time he fights, but I think Morono’s one of the most improved UFC fighters we have seen recent years…but that’s mainly because he was pretty awful when he started. I used him in a double for his last fight against Court McGee, which I believed was one of the softest lay-ups a fighter has been given all year…and Morono made it way harder than it needed to be and actually made COURT MCGEE look like a good striker. That fight was literally two months ago, so I think to ignore that glaringly obvious red flag would be foolish.

So this is a fight between two guys that you simply cannot trust, and therefore one that you should not be betting. I obviously pick Morono to be the favourite, as his concerns could easily be attributed to a bad/off day, whilst Price’s career has been skidding for over half a decade….but -275 is a steep price on a fight so volatile. If you’re someone who wants to throw a small amount on every fight to keep it fun, then Price has to be the dog of choice (he even has a KO win over Morono already, for the little that’s worth). But for everyone else, leave this one alone.

**How I line this fight:** A line of coke would be less chaos than this fight.

**Bet or pass:** Pass

**Prop leans:** None

 

**\~Phil Rowe v Jake Matthews\~**

Fighters like Jake Matthews remind me that I’ve been in this game for way too long, because I’m sick of writing the same narratives about certain competitors.

Jake Matthews is a complicated fighter because he is incredibly unreliable, and I believe this is because he is both overrated and sometimes underrated, and therefore hard to line correctly. He was groomed as the face of Australiasian MMA before Rob and Izzy came along, so about 80% of his UFC record is pathetic can crushing in an attempt to make him look better than he is. The UFC randomly chose violence and threw him in against Michael Morales, where he actually outperformed his +250 price tag and looked competitive striking against one of the more interesting prospects at the moment. But whilst that looks like a positive sign…Matthews also lost to Matt Semelsberger just three fights ago. So who fucking knows.

Phil Rowe doesn’t inspire a whole lot of confidence either, as I believe him to be similarly unreliable and hard to predict. The 33-year-old is 0-3 in decisions, which I personally think is a very telling statistic as it clearly describes you as dangerous yet incompetent. His UFC career has seen him lose decisions to Gabe Green and Neil Magny, whilst knocking out Niko Price, Jason Witt, and Orion Cosce.

Fights are much more complex than considering whether the finisher can find a finish, but I think it’s the key question here. Matthews can \*sometimes\* be a tough guy to look good against, and not the easiest guy to finish either….which leads me to believe that a Matthews decision win is a very plausible path to victory. However, as I’ve said…trusting Jake Matthews is only for those with a high appetite for risk, as you never truly know what you’re going to get.

I don’t have a strong opinion on this fight, but in terms of a betting line I was fine seeing it so close. Since then, it seems Matthews has gone on to strengthen as a favourite, which makes me now think this line is a little bit wide. My reasoning was more so that I thought both fighters are 50% capable of losing, as opposed to both fighters have 50% potential to win. So I’d need more than +130 to +150 to want to back the dog here really.

I was keen on Jake Matthews’ Decision win prop though, as I felt he is quite limited in terms of winning methods these days, and should have the minute winning advantage against Rowe (who is yet to actually win a professional decision). With the recent line movement in Matthews’ favour, there probably won’t be a good enough price on that one. I’d want to +200 there.

**How I line this fight:** Jake Matthews +100 (50%), Phil Rowe +100 (50%)

**Bet or pass:** 0.5u Jake Matthews by Decision (+200 or better…very unlikely that price is anywhere near)

**Prop leans:** See above

 

**\~Mickey Gall v Basil Hafez\~**

The return of Basil Hafez. I was quite enthusiastic in trying to fade him when he was initially supposed to face Preston Parsons, arguing that pressure wrestling a guy like Jack Della Maddalena was a one-way ticket to becoming incredibly overrated. I fancied a fellow wrestler like Parsons to ask the question and felt there was value there. Given how Parsons looked that week against Semelsberger, I reckon I was on to something.

But Mickey Gall is a very different stylistic matchup, so we have to re-assess if the fade is on. Firstly, Gall is a pretty decent submission threat, which makes this one interesting considering Hafez’s seemingly endless display of takedowns will increase the chances of a submission presenting itself in the scramble. Gall isn’t a particularly good striker, but he’s definitely shown himself to be capable of looking good against other fighters we deem ‘bad’ strikers. He might well have a bit of a striking advantage here.

Gall’s takedown defence is pretty bad though, and his submission game so far has almost exclusively been demonstrated from top position. Whilst I do think Gall has a chance at finding a submission here, the style he is going up against can be an absolute nightmare if you don’t at least have the takedown defence to keep your opponent honest. We haven’t really seen Gall face that kind of stylistic challenge yet, but remembering that the likes of Diego Sanchez was able to use takedowns to score a finish over Gall…it doesn’t really fill me with confidence.

Hafez getting a win here could be a good thing long term, because I am poised and ready to fade the guy. This isn’t the time though, in my opinion…so it’s a pass all round for me. I will be hoping that Hafez gets an easy win to further inflate the hype and the price tag, but I do not believe he is going to have a long UFC career once he gets round out.

**How I line this fight:** Mickey Gall +200 (33%), Basil Haffez -200 (67%)

**Bet or pass:** Pass

**Prop leans:** None

 

**\~Ailin Perez vs Joselyne Edwards\~**

Ailin Perez is possibly one of my most confident picks on the entire card, which is hilarious. I’m quite familiar with both women’s game, and this feels like a gift of a matchup for her stylistically.

Joselyne Edwards is your quintessential WMMA fighter. Decent volume on the feet, with straight shots that don’t really do any damage but will land consistently. She mixes in takedowns when she feels she needs to, but her top position grappling isn’t particularly amazing and is hardly a trump card. Defensively, she takes a similar amount as she gives, and has historically been pretty bad at defending takedowns. The figures say it’s a 64% defense, but the win over Ramona Pascual skews that percentage massively because she defended a high volume there.

We know what we’re getting from Perez – suffocating tenacity as she looks to get in her opponent’s face, throw bombs and land a takedown. Her game is quite sloppy and rough around the edges, but the judges do not score technique, and it certainly is effective. In that sense, she’s kind of similar to a Vanessa Demopoulos…and we know how good she is at winning fights with fuck all talent.

The easiest way to stifle an approach like Perez’s is to have some sort of threat that will keep her honest, whether that be in the form or striking power or good clinch work. Joselyne Edwards is certainly lacking in the power department, with little to no power and even less of a submission game. She doesn’t have the best footwork either, so I overall struggle to see how she’s going to stop Ailin from corralling her up against the fence and finding her takedown entry.

Once Perez finds it, I think it should be one way traffic. Edwards may be able to stay safe from anything dangerous, or perhaps find a few avenues back to the feet…but Perez has shown she has absolutely no problem in the rinse and repeat takedown approach. She can stick to Edwards like glue, and smother her from a dominant position, and I just don’t think Edwards is going to have any answer for it long term. I do have a concern or two about Perez’s cardio, after she blew her load against Pudilova, but that’s probably Edwards’ clearest path to a win.

In my mind, a win for Edwards is likely going to be a competitive 15 minutes that could end up being a split. For Perez, it could come from damage on the feet with her wild striking, or from serious minutes of top control where she wins rounds with relative ease. Clearly that means I think Perez wins this at a high clip as long as the cardio doesn’t play a part.

Edwards is tough so I’m not sure I see Perez getting a finish, but I do think this should be one way traffic, for the first two rounds at least. Perez to win at -250 actually felt like a reasonable pricetag to me, so I was surprised to see it trending downwards and that she’s around the -200 mark here. Personally I was interested in using -250 in a small parlay, but now I’m anticipating I’ll be playing a SGP with Perez to Win & Over 1.5 Rounds. I think this one will become a long term grind, and that suits Perez perfectly because she’s such a dog. If I get -150 or better for that, it’s on.

**How I line this fight:** Ailin Perez -300 (75%), Joselyne Edwards +300 (25%)

**Bet or pass:** 1u Ailin Perez to Win & Over 1.5 Rounds (-150 or better)

**Prop leans:** See above (an SGP counts as a prop bet to me)

 

**\~Andre Lima v Mitch Raposo\~**

This fight was announced just as I ran out of time, so no writeup for me. I remember Raposo being a bit of a sloppy wrestler on TUF, but I’ve no other opinions.

 

**Bets (Bold = been placed)**

2u Sean Strickland to Win in Rounds 4, 5 or by Decision (+175)

2u **Kevin Holland & Grant Dawson to Win** (+110)

2u **Cesar Almeida to Win** (+125)

1u **Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos to Win** (+150)

0.5u Jake Matthews to Win by Decision (+200 or better…highly unlikely we get anywhere near this)

1u Ailin Perez to Win + Over 1.5 Rounds (-150 or better)

**Parlay Pieces:** Kevin Holland, Grant Dawson, Ailin Perez

**Dog of the Week:** Cesar Almeida

**Picks:** Makhachev, Strickland, Holland, J. Almeida, EZDS, C. Almeida, Dawson, Matthews, Morono, Hafez, Perez

This is the first time I’ve listed my ‘picks’, which I’ve historically been against doing. As the value of my betting-based content has gone down the toilet in recent months, I figured it makes sense to pivot towards the parlay betting folks to make all this writing a bit more worthwhile for the community.

This comes with a warning though – just because I pick someone to win, does not mean I think you should bet them. A ‘pick’ is a binary thing, which means I am expecting X fighter to have 51% or more chance of winning…which is almost always going to actually be lower than the betting line itself. For example, I’ve picked Hafez, but I don’t think he should be anywhere near -350 – I therefore do not advise betting him at all.

That struck a chord for some reason -- my reply.

It's interesting how we all see the same investment slightly differently. For me lotto is pure chance only improved infinitesimally by buying more tickets -- basically it will be what it will be. 

SAVA is a calculated risk with many of the risk elements slowly marked off the list with time and results. We know the MOA is covered, the product does not produce ARIA, the product is extremely safe (relative to existing approved options) and clinically meaningful efficacy has been demonstrated (24mths no decline in cognitive function for mild). Most importantly the protocols for the trial and expected measures for success are predefined and aligned with the agency that is the gatekeeper to the market (the SPAs).

SAVA has the best resources producing the product, monitoring the trial sites and the industry reference standard biostatisticians supporting the data analysis such that SAVA would know if anything were amiss in the trials while also having good visibility to the trending performance of the trial population. 

Finally I would contend that the continued insider buying and holding strongly suggest that the results are heading towards an affirmative outcome much higher than one could hope for via a lottery pick.",LABEL_2

After a significant move on Thursday 05/23 (a big gap reversal off of a new all-time high, compression, sustained late-day selling) and pre-holiday trading, the market was likely in for a day of rest. There was a small opportunity early in the day to get long (see the annotated chart below), but there was no reason to expect a sustained move right before the holiday weekend. Once the good volume from the early part of the session disappeared 2.5 hours into the day, it was likely that SPY would chop around for the rest of the day given the backdrop.

[05\/24 SPY M5](https://preview.redd.it/y23pitjed13d1.png?width=3456&format=png&auto=webp&s=65455e6175f4c8899dff6d947f4553cab25ae165)

Toward the middle of last week (before NVDA earnings), I became suspicious about the strength of the 05/15 breakout and the conviction of buyers. If buyers were aggressive and wanted to buy this breakout, we would have seen follow-through by this point. The fact that there was no follow-through buying following the 05/15 breakout for the next several trading sessions and the compressed, tiny-bodied D1 candles indicated that sellers were not letting buyers advance the market forward. Regardless of whether the NVDA earnings reaction would be bullish, the lack of follow-through on the 05/15 breakout already suggested not getting overly aggressive.

My suspicion about the conviction of buyers was confirmed on 05/23 with the formation of a long red D1 bearish engulfing candle on a gap reversal off a new all-time high (post-NVDA earnings announcement). The NVDA earnings were excellent, but I had warned you the night of the NVDA earnings to not get overly excited with the idea that SPY was about to put in a bullish trend day on a gap up to a new all-time high. Gaps up to new all-time highs or relative highs are notorious for being easily reversed.

If you look at the D1 chart of SPY, we can extract some very valuable information about where we are right now:

https://preview.redd.it/3e3m4zrne13d1.png?width=3456&format=png&auto=webp&s=2910ca79b139606e1bbd7d63203cac9a37ddfe8e

1. There has been no follow-through on the 05/15 all-time high breakout. This is a sign that buyers are not aggressive, and sellers are not letting buyers advance the market higher.
2. There is resistance at the all-time high. We saw many failed attempts pre-NVDA earnings from buyers to break out intraday above the previous all-time high at 531.56. The immediate gap reversal off the new all-time high at 533.07 (not counting pre-open session high) on 05/23, buyers' inability to retrace much of that selling, and sustained late-day selling confirm that resistance.
3. We are, in my opinion, only marginally higher than the previous all-time high at 524.61 from late March.

Why does SPY being only ""marginally higher"" than the previous all-time high from late March even matter? It matters because it tells us that buyers are struggling to materially move the market much higher from here. From early November 2023 to March 2024, we had a very powerful rally with virtually no dips. We received our first warning sign on 04/04 from the massive bearish engulfing candle off the all-time high. That warning sign was ""confirmed"" following the selling through the SMA 50 and a pullback to the SMA 100. When SPY found support above the SMA 100, we saw a rather wimpy light volume rally back up to the prior all-time high. Light volume rallies are not bearish; they just cannot be trusted as much. That means we trade smaller sizes and are on the lookout for warning signs that the rally may be weakening.

We did finally get that breakout to a new all-time high, but as I've discussed, it has been unimpressive with no follow-through buying. Buyers have been served another warning sign of resistance on the 05/23 candle (similar to 04/04).

... so ...

Does this mean that the top is in and that it's time to start aggressively shorting? Absolutely not! I am not suggesting that ""the top is in"" or that the market is about to roll over hard and that you need to short. I am simply pointing out clues from the SPY D1 price action that tell me to be cautious. The market could very well recover from the 05/23 bearish engulfing candle and start marching higher to new all-time highs. To start swing shorts aggressively, we need technical confirmation in the D1 chart. We don't have that right now.

What I strongly suggest is being cautious with any new swing positions here. Until I see how the D1 price action unfolds following the 05/23 candle, I will favor day trading over swing trading. If I find a very strong stock with a beautiful D1 chart where I have nearby support and feel confident, I may consider a small-sized long, but I would not look to overstay my welcome.

## Where do we go from here following 05/23

Given the importance of the SPY D1 chart right now, I will lay out what both buyers and sellers would want to see from here to support their cause.

I also feel that we may see volatility pick up and the intraday ranges expand. I will refer to this as the ""battleground"" scenario. This would be indicative of buyers and sellers battling it out, with large intraday ranges where we can expect two-sided action intraday. Buyers and sellers would both take turns moving the market.

The final and most unfortunate scenario for us as traders I will also lay out. I'll refer to this as ""LPTE Hell."" This would transpire as tiny D1 candles with compressed intraday ranges on light volume where we do not get any sort of confirmation and see LPTE-like ""wait and see mode"" conditions until we get new economic news in early June.

### Buyers

Buyers want to quickly recover all the losses from the D1 05/23 candle. That means consecutive green candles that ideally come on heavy volume. It is not enough to just recover all the 05/23 losses. Buyers want to see SPY immediately get follow-through buying on a new all-time high. That would be a sign that buyers are becoming more aggressive and overpowering sellers.

### Sellers

Sellers want the open of the 05/23 candle to hold, and ideally, the halfway point of it. A rally on mixed overlapping candles to the high on light volume, followed by a long red bearish engulfing candle on heavy volume, would be bearish. Right now, you can see that SPY is at the halfway point of the 05/23 candle. A brief compression here followed by long red candles on heavy volume that fill in the 05/15 gap up would be even more bearish.

### Battleground

How will you know if this begins to unfold? If you see the intraday ranges start to expand (look at the SPY ATR) and two-sided price action where buyers and sellers take turns holding the ball (i.e. buying that stalls out, look for sellers to test the downside). This is very good for day trading as the intraday range expansion will provide nice moves to trade from both the long and short sides.

[ATR expands and volatility increases after 04\/04 long red bearish engulfing candle](https://preview.redd.it/q53okbxwe13d1.png?width=3456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2a7bc5dfc7ca7591a82612d6651df174ece4f4e)

### LPTE Hell

The LPTE chop demons from hell would love to see SPY not move much here and for SPY to stay relatively flat for the week with compressed D1 candles. They would want to see SPY in ""wait and see"" mode until the next round of economic releases in early June. Even better, they would love for $BA to be the only stock to show up on scanners. They would love for you to get long on $BA only for $BA to have a ""sudden"" news drop where one long red candle takes out the entire day's gains. If this scenario plays out, buyers/sellers should remain very passive.

## The 05/28 Session

Given that we are coming back from a long holiday weekend, it's likely that we'll see light volume post-holiday ""hangover"" LPTE trading conditions. SPY will likely be trapped inside the prior day's range (05/24). For this reason, I would err on the side of keeping it light/not trading unless the market gives us a compelling reason to take a trade. I will conduct scenario analysis for the open as usual from both perspectives of what buyers and sellers would want to see.

SPY will start the day off toward the tail end of a bullish 1OP cycle.

### Support

* 524.72 (the low from 05/23)
* 526.88 (the low from 05/24)

### Resistance

* 530.27 (the high from 05/24)
* 531.56 (the previous all-time high and lower high from 05/23)
* 533.07 (the all-time high)

# Open Scenarios

## Gap up above 530.27

### Buyers

#### Gap n go

If we see a ""gap n go"" toward the 531.56 level/all-time high with consecutive green candles and good volume, I would be very cautious joining the move up. Sellers have smacked the market down several times from here, and I feel that the risk to the downside would be much more elevated than normal. I would need to see very significant signs of heavy buying pressure to want to join this move. I would be more than happy to miss this move up if I can gather new information that buyers are very aggressive and can make a new all-time high. That would give me more confidence to get long, but as you can probably tell, that would likely take some time to play out.

#### Double bottom higher low test for support at 530.27

A better scenario to get long would be where a bearish 1OP cross/cycle begins shortly after the open. If SPY moves higher initially and confirms support during the bearish 1OP cycle (higher low double bottom on retest of support at the prior day's high/compression at the open), I would feel more comfortable getting long knowing that I at least have some support to lean on and a little bit of room toward 531.56 to ride a long. If SPY approaches 531.56 on mixed overlapping candles and light volume, I would be ready to exit any long. If I see a bearish engulf at that level or a bearish hammer, I would exit any day trading long.

### Sellers

#### Wimpy move higher

Sellers would want to see the bullish 1OP cycle struggle to move SPY up toward 531.56 on mixed overlapping candles and light volume. I would feel comfortable opening a starter short position on a bearish hammer or bearish engulf off the high of the day at or below 531.56 on the notion that that resistance level will hold and the bearish 1OP cycle will produce. If SPY quickly takes out the open and makes a new low of the day on consecutive selling, I would feel comfortable adding to that starter position.

#### Gap fill on stacked red candles

If SPY stacks consecutive long red candles on heavy volume to start the day and finish off the bullish 1OP cycle, I would feel comfortable getting short. This would confirm to me that sellers are aggressive and that resistance near the all-time high is very firm. Assuming the selling pressure is steady during the bearish 1OP cycle, I would look to hold any shorts under the assumption that the next bullish 1OP is going to produce a failed bounce. On confirmation of that failed bounce, I would look to add to my short positions. The market would very likely continue to move down toward the low of the day from Friday at 526.88.

## Open inside the prior day's range between 526.88 and 530.27

### Buyers

Buyers would want to see a nice little grind higher on the open toward the high of the day from Friday. Consecutive green candles on good volume would be ideal. On the bearish 1OP cross, a compression near the high of the day or a wimpy drift lower forming a higher low double bottom would be bullish. If either a compression at the high of the day happens and the market breaks out to a new high of the day on a bullish 1OP cross or that higher low double bottom forms and the market is above VWAP, an opportunity to get long may set up. Watch for resistance at 530.27 and then 531.56.

### Sellers

Sellers would want to see a wimpy move up on the finish of the bullish 1OP cycle. A long red bearish engulfing candle on heavy volume at the high of the day would signal to me that the next bearish 1OP cycle is likely going to produce. I would feel comfortable opening a starter short here, and if SPY easily takes out the open, I would consider adding. Watch for support at 526.88 (prior low of the day).

## Gap down below 526.88

### Buyers

#### Gap fill on stacked green candles

Stacked green candles on heavy volume to start the day would be a sign that buyers are very aggressive. I would want to see how the bearish 1OP cycle plays out. If SPY compresses near the high of the day or puts in a wimpy drift lower that is unable to take out the open of the last long green candle, you can get long on the strongest stocks when you see a bullish engulf. The next bullish 1OP will very likely send SPY higher.

#### More than half of the gap filled

If buyers can fill in more than half of the gap at the open and the next bearish 1OP cycle produces a higher low double bottom above the open, that would be a sign of good support. You can open a starter long on a bullish engulf off that higher low and add on confirmation. This is not as bullish as the gap fill on stacked greens but would make me feel comfortable knowing that we have support. Buyers want to see steady buying from this point and for SPY to not struggle to move higher.

### Sellers

#### Gap n go

Stacked red candles on heavy volume at the open would be bearish, especially as the bullish 1OP cycle is still ongoing. Be careful as SPY approaches support at 524.72. If you have a short on early, you want to see SPY blow through that 524.72 and start filling in the 05/15 gap up. If you start seeing mixed overlapping price action near that 524.72 level, I would expect a bounce. As long as those stacked red candles are not given up and the bounce is wimpy, you can stay short. A failed bounce that doesn't recover much of those red candles may prompt me to add to the short position under the premise that SPY will attempt to break down below 524.72 again. Sellers will want to see SPY easily blow through that level on the next attempt.

#### Wimpy move higher into the gap + lower high double top

Mixed overlapping candles on the open into the gap that fails to take out much of the gap (halfway point) would be a sign that buyers are not aggressive. A bearish hammer or bearish engulf off the high of the day would be enough for me to get short under the assumption that the bearish 1OP cycle will produce. A new low of the day would prompt me to add to the starter, and I would want to see SPY blow through support at 524.72.",LABEL_1

**Background and context**

As an introvert I have a hard time finding motivation to yell into the void about my game. I sent emails and made a post when the demo was launched and got covered by one youtuber with the video receiving 100 views. After that I crawled back into my cave to work on the game and forgot about marketing.

Since I enjoy numbers and statistics, I decided to try reach the magic wishlists mark with paid advertising, mostly on Reddit but also some Twitter and Facebook. The goal was to receive the blessings of the Steam algorithm at launch by getting on Popular Upcoming so I was fine if the strategy lost a bit of money per wishlist.

[Here is my game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2459490?utm_source=org&utm_medium=rd&utm_campaign=gamedev&utm_content=ads) for some context. It's a nerdy 2D tycoon life sim, not the type that goes viral with cool gifs but does appeal to a niche.

**The Reddit ad format**

I decided to ""borrow"" Hooded Horse's ad format since they're a very successful publisher and must know what they're doing. From what I can gather (and reading other Reddit ad post mortems) the best strategy is:

* The title should describe the game's hook or a unique feature. Don't bother including the name, nobody cares. E.g. for mine the most successful titles were ""A life sim where your characters have allergies and addictions"" or ""Be an investment banker with a paperwork allergy or a single parent with a shopping addiction""
* The image should show in-game screenshots. Don't use a trailer, nobody cares, everyone is scrolling their feed to see something interesting quickly. An exception is if you have an action-y game where you can show something cool in the first few seconds.
* Don't use cover art either. People can't tell what it is, or worse you'll get the wrong people clicking thinking it's something it's not therefore wasting your money.
* I edit the images to fit more relevant things in a smaller space, but it's representative of what the game looks like. [Here are two examples.](http://pokingwatergames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240527-AdExamples.png)

**Setting up ad groups and ads**

* Set up different ad groups based on similar subreddits. Do not use interest groups or keywords. Untick the ""Expand Your Audience"" checkbox. Use the Cost Per Click (CPC) strategy and set your CPC cap to the minimum allowed of $0.10
* For each ad, set the destination URL with UTM tracking so you know how each performs once it reaches Steam. For example, something like [https://store.steampowered.com/app/XXXX?utm\_source=ad&utm\_medium=reddit&utm\_campaign=stardewvalley&utm\_content=cutedogwithfarmer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/XXXX?utm_source=ad&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=stardewvalley&utm_content=cutedogwithfarmer)
* For my particular game I experimented with 15-20 ad groups for life sim / colony sim / tycoon / strategy games and finance-related subreddits. If a single subreddit had an audience size >500k then it got its own ad group.
* I didn't target r/Games or r/Gaming or anything like that. They seem too generic and in all the post mortems I've read that went badly, these were the target audiences. My gut feeling is not to use them unless you're at least a popular indie studio in a popular genre and releasing on multiple platforms. Same goes for r/Indiegaming being too generic and half full of other gamedevs.
* Don't make the audience size in each ad group too small. Since the minimum spend is $5 per ad group you can easily reach saturation if your audience is smaller than \~100k.
* Don't exclude mobile targeting even for a PC-only game. Across all my ads, 90% of Tracked Visits and 96% of Tracked Wishlists came from mobile. As long as you target subreddits of games with a large PC audience you should be hitting the correct audience even if they're on their phone.

**Experimentation and analysis**

* [Here's part of my UTM Analytics](http://pokingwatergames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20231127-UTMStats.png)
* One important metric is Wishlists (WL) to Tracked Visits (TV) ratio, which tells you how many people logged into Steam decided to wishlist. For me this was anywhere from 0% (no one was interested) to 25% (decent interest). The percentage will vary depending on your target audience which is why it's important to separate them into ad groups.
* The click tracking on Steam's end won't match Reddit's tracking, presumably because Reddit tries to filter spam/bot clicks while Steam doesn't. I tried to derive some meaning or metric behind the Steam Trusted Visits but nothing made sense. Often there were dozens of Trusted Visits before the ad was enabled! I think it's best to ignore this number.
* When starting out, it's ok to make changes every 2-3 days (but not less than 48h) and stop something that's massively underperforming. E.g if an ad has 0 WL from 100 TV, I would immediately stop it and try another experiment. 10 WL from 100 TV, I would give a week to see if it increases before deciding whether to keep it/tweak it/stop it. 25 WL from 100 TV, I'm doubling the budget.
* This also applies to the CTR as displayed on the Reddit Dashboard. From reading other posts, the CTR on Reddit ads averages 0.2%. However my CTRs were usually higher than 0.8% and averaged 1.5-2.0% when targeting relevant game-related subreddits. If CTR is low but WL to TV is high (they might be interested, they just don't know it!) adjust your ads for the audience until something resonates. If CTR is high but WL to TV is low, then you have the wrong audience (or your Steam page sucks / doesn't reflect the ad).
* Related to the above, [here's some of my best CTR subreddits](http://pokingwatergames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240514-RedditAdsHighCTR.png). 4-6% CTR is crazy but it makes sense in context. Both are PC-only games like mine. Capitalism Lab was an inspiration for some game mechanics and when Big Ambitions came out I remember thinking, ""cool that's kinda like my game"".

**Other insights and discoveries**

* Targeting non-English countries was about 60-70% the CPC of English-speaking countries. The WL rate was similar or even better sometimes even for my untranslated game, so don't exclude them. I went with the assumption that almost everyone on Reddit can read English since it's such a heavily text-based platform and this seems to have paid off.
* Having said that, you can't adjust the bid amount based on country so I only targeted countries where the game's price on Steam had a chance of breaking even on the ad money.
* In terms of cost per WL, it's hard to calculate because some people might click an ad while not logged into Steam then jump on their PC to wishlist it. Some might tell their friends. My average WL before ads was \~4/day but fluctuated a lot. The total WL increase was \~2x the tracked WL. Based on this the cost per WL was roughly $1.10 but varied anywhere from $0.80-$2.50 depending on the ad group. If I only targeted the tiny niche that was most successful (spreadsheet-y tycoon games) it might actually be profitable.
* You can't run an ad group forever. After a few weeks at a decent budget you'll start getting diminishing CTR and WL rates. Have a pipeline of new audiences to try if you want to keep the momentum going.
* I also used Twitter and Facebook ads with similar strategies as above. Twitter had terrible CTR and lower WL to TV than Reddit when targeting the same audiences but CPC was dirt cheap. Facebook was almost a failure until I stumbled on something that seemed to work. I didn't have time to experiment properly though so don't feel confident giving advice on it.

In total I spent $4365 (USD) to get on Popular Upcoming. The usual disclaimer, this is my experience and others might have wildly better/worse results. Would be interested to hear other's experiences with paid advertising and what worked best.",LABEL_1
2024-05-27 23:01:45,What I learned from Daily trading in the past 18 months?,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1d227qa/what_i_learned_from_daily_trading_in_the_past_18/,"Hello traders, 

As part of our duty to share awareness and knowledge, I'll be sharing some points that I've learned and discovered throughout my trip in daily trading for the past 18 months. Upfront, I'm not a professional trader nor working in the financial sector, I'm just a guy who's dreaming to grow my bank account balance.

# - Start with a demo account.

Guys, don't sacrifice your equity with try and error scheme, lots of trading platforms and exchange sites offers you to start with a demo account with virtual equity instead of using your real money. I highly recommend this as a start in order to understand the market's movement.

# - Stay away from Small timeframes.

Candles can be tricky sometimes, due to lots of fluctuations. Small timeframes such as (1min, 5min) can be a trap by showing massive movements in candles which can be immediately spotted if you minimised the Y-Axis (Price Axes). Price changes are more consistent on bigger timeframes.

# - Understand the market movements.

This should be your ABC in order to understand what's controlling the prices, a short course would help you a lot. For example to understand some indicators and what's Support, Resistance, Caps and most importantly what's the effect of Volume.

# - Don't leverage unless you're sure.

The purpose of Leverage is to give you virtual equity in a position, which can be a Two Sided sword, in one side, your profits can be great, but on the other side, your loses can be disastrous. Lots of platforms can give you up to 200x leverage, sounds thrilling, but trust me you shouldn't exceed 15x leverage.

# - Don't panic and control your emotions.

Candles are moving like a Spring, when a spring extends, you should expect a release pressure movement. At some point, you might be looking with a pale face into your PnL and suddenly it can reverse to some fine profits, trust your analysis. Determine the correct entry point in order to avoid losses. Don't panic when you see a trend going up or down, this will only cost you money.

# - Don't overtrade, don't be greedy.

Oh boy, one of the things that I learned the hard way is Not To Overtrade. Greed can cause you some serious loses. If you won a trade, that's perfect, don't be overconfident, because at that point you'll be under the influence of money and greed. Just take your profits home and be satisfied.

# - Don't lose money.

Guys, if you have 100$, and you lost 50% of them (50$), you know that you'll need to win 100% again of that 50$ in order to get back to your initial 100$. Therefore, focus on your trades and don't lose money.

# - Profits will come, just trust the process.

You shouldn't expect immediate profits, trading needs so much experience and luck. Hence, loses should be expected and shouldn't affect your state of mind. Focus more and learn from your mistakes.

# - Buy the bottom and sell the dip.

Once you master defining resistance and support lines, you'll be able to determine when the price will change course. With good analysis you will be confident of your position instead of entering through ongoing trend which is unpredictable. 

  
Happy Trading Everyone :D

--

**Current Stock Price and Market Capitalization:**

* **Current Stock Price**: $1.16 (as of the latest update 27th May 2024).
* **Outstanding Shares**: Approximately 20.65 million shares.

To calculate the market capitalization:  
Market Capitalization=Stock Price×Outstanding Shares  
Market Capitalization=1.16×20,650,000≈**$23.95 million**   


**Net Assets (Equity) Calculation:**  
From the previous financial data:

* **Total Assets**: $579.5 million
* **Total Liabilities**: $317.7 million

Net Assets (Equity)=Total Assets−Total Liabilities  
Net Assets (Equity)=579.5−317.7=**$261.8 million**

So, pure based on Net Assets they are undervalued. However: 

1. **Technological Innovations**:
   * The company's advanced electric vehicle technology and proprietary AI systems enhance its market value. 
2. **Brand Value**:
   * The brand recognition and market positioning in the luxury electric vehicle segment add significant intangible value. High-profile vehicle owners and Co-Creation Officers such as Chris Brown, Motev and others, demonstrating strong brand power.
3. **Future Growth Prospects**:
   * Potential for market expansion, especially with plans to enter the Middle East market and increased production capabilities.

  
And some interesting points mentioned in [this](https://app-us.ff.com/ff-v3/news/724?lang=en-US) shareholder letter: 

* FF is only one of five new EV companies globally that has passed US homologation requirements, others include Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, and Fisker.
*  $3 billion invested capital to date to create an industry leading EV platform, I.A.I. technology, product development and manufacturing capabilities.
* 660 patents filed or issued utility and design patents for both EV and I.A.I. technology competitiveness.
* 10,000 capacity - future potential annual production capacity at FF's self-operated manufacturing facility in Hanford, California with $200+ million invested.

FF also signed an agreement with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) to unleash generative AI and advanced EVs for Abu Dhabi's SAVI cluster. Abu Dhabi’s SAVI cluster builds on the strength of Abu Dhabi’s industrial base and supports the UAE’s target of half of all cars on the roads being electric by 2050.

Secondly, I’ve seen people talking about how the squeeze has already happened because it went from $0.04 to $3.90. I think most of us can agree that this development was 1) the result of retail investors massively investing in a opportunity 2) investors with short positions executing a ladder attack on 5/17 to kill moral. 

Thirdly, some people mentioned a short percentage of 31%, which just doesn’t make sense. Although 31% is still huge, I think the best analysis of this was the report that was shared on Discord and on Reddit indicating that this percentage was approximately 60%+. Looking at buy orders every day, the distribution of the shares etc, I just don’t see a way that short positions have already been recovered in such large numbers. Moreover, nobody knows exactly what the percentage is off-market. Either way, the shorts have betted on delisting, I think that is clear to most. In the meantime we have bought the most shares, with we I mean retail investors. So if we hold as long as possible, a squeeze is inevitable if we maintain the $1 until Friday. Now this last mentioned issue is also why I am certain that the squeeze hasn’t happened yet. Short investors have been fighting like hell to prevent this. I think we all know why. 

Last of all, I also think that there are members in this subreddit that are retail investors but have also shorted, maybe to hedge their high average cost, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see that people are spreading fear here in order to gain advantage for themselves. Don’t let anybody fool you and just analyse everything that has been posted here, in the RealFFIE subreddit and on Discord. Most of us can agree that the short squeeze has far from happened and that we are on our way to something huge. Use your clever minds, buckle up for the next three days and then we will eventually prove that the majority is right, that we are on to something huge.

Why? Because he does one thing and one thing only even if the other community worships him like a cult leader - he only cares about his own bags. Now he has flip flopped after the Eth ETF approval as if he didn't say anything one week ago - let me tell you I wouldn't be surprised one bit if he comes out in the future saying he holds Ethereum.

2024-05-25 04:56:55,Silver's Macro Roadmap ,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/1d02d70/silvers_macro_roadmap/,"This is for educational purposes only and not for trading or investment advice...

I haven't posted the long-term silver chart since last September which the fractal and symmetrical triangle was calling for this breakout but suffice it to say, the updated chart pattern (which dates back to 1935) is nothing short of phenomenal.  Studying chart patterns across both commodity and stock sectors, the silver chart pattern is indeed something to behold.

You can take this for what its worth, but looking at the BIG picture, we should move quickly to $50 (by October 2024) before any serious correction back down to $36.  This price action will complete a 100-year pattern in play, whereas silver turns around from approx. $36, smashes through $50 (on the 4th attempt) and all blue sky from there.

The % up move and parabolic trend which captures the 1st bull market from 1935 to 1980 will make triple digit silver on the low side of the projected target.  Does this imply we may very well hyper-inflate, yes it does or we simply turn the silver deficit into the biggest silver shortage any commodity has experienced.  It could be one or the other or combination and then FOMO will kick in.  This pattern is clean, precise and text book, so probability is 90% price behavior will unfold very close to the above analysis.

This would also imply corrections will be very short lived but volatile in the paper market, as the bull will shake off the weak hands and test resolve of the strong hands.  This is extremely healthy as the market works through the correction only strong hands reside in a position and short-term specs are kicked off.  But there will be no more long painful bleeds, but more big spikes in both directions taking out the big orders of both buy and sell stops, this is the whipsaw action we have seen recently and will increase, but the duration again will be short lived.  Silver REALLY wants to MOVE HIGHER but now waiting for GOLD to get its act together.  Note; we have seen a healthy drop in GSR from near 90 to 76.... don't look for the 10:1 right now as this would only imply the bull PM may have run its course.  The fact that Silver is @ $30 and GSR is at 76 is anecdotal evidence the bull has several years to run and the prices for both gold and silver will be astronomical.

For those that comment that loaf of bread will be $100 in this case, and if that turns out to be true, be thankful you have silver which could buy a truckload of bread, which is example of preserving wealth, return of the investment vs return on the investment.  Jordan Byrne stated a couple weeks ago the silver pattern (50 years) is the best he has ever witnessed...this is correct, but he was not looking at the whole picture, and again, if we have the same % move from '35 to '80, silver will have its bitcoin moment.

The purpose of the post is to not sensationalize the possibility of silver's move but to convey that from here on out, the long consolidation periods, sideways movements and containment of the big short sellers pinning silver price under $25 is over... Bix Weir after posting 1000 videos calling for the bullion banks ending the manipulation in silver has finally come to fruition, ...albeit they may have added increase short positions, they now have to buy those sells back and will need to compete with new longs entering a position and as the weak hands have already sold, the number of sellers remaining will be nada....the shorts are screwed... the PM trading desk did not get the memo, but they will, but the memo in this case will be their walking papers.  Stay long, stay strong.",LABEL_1

The growing volume of transactions has driven its price upwards. A similar trend is now observable with Litecoin.

Copium?

* Litecoin is recognized as one of the most widely used cryptocurrencies for transactions, ranking third after Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of transactional volume. Its fast transaction times and low fees make it a preferred choice for everyday transactions.

* Despite its substantial transactional use, Litecoin's market cap is significantly lower than Bitcoin's and Ethereum's—by hundreds of billions of dollars. This disparity suggests that LTC is undervalued relative to its utility and market presence.

Litecoin appears to be significantly undervalued compared to its peers. The combination of high transactional use, substantial upgrades, and growing adoption points to an upcoming surge in its price as the market begins to recognize its intrinsic value.

BTC accumulated upwards in the same way, solely through sheer use of the network and mass adoption.

Absolutely incredible conditions in the market for bullish movement for longs after that phenomenal quarter from $NVDA. So long as they don't pull it down under 1000 psychological level, I think we can assume a nice, sustained continuation of the current aggressive move upwards.

1. $MAXN: this bottomed out solar energy ticker can make a potentially outsized move to the upside if it can break over resistance levels of 3.30, 3.40, 3.60 and 4. This ticker holds a squeezability score of 64% and a juice target of 7.3 in the best-case scenario. Let's keep this one on close watch in case it can clear over that 4 level particularly for a larger squeeze move and continued bullish price action. Key support levels you want it to hold are 3.30, 3 psychological level and danger zone below 2.70. Let's keep it on watch to see how it goes today.

1. $SPWR: this new age meme stock is also among the recent squeezers from the solar energy sector and remains on high watch for potential reversal back higher again. The data is still compelling, and chart is intriguing if we can break resistance of 3.3 and 3.75 in the near-term for 4-5+ range. The squeezability data is incredibly strong on this ticker at 90% and a juice target of 13.1 in a best-case scenario. On the support side, we would like to see it hold 3 psychological level and then 2.6-2.7 are the last chance for bulls to hold any rally.

1. $MARA: the King of Bitcoin miners makes it back onto the SqueezeFinder watchlist thanks to a mix of strong data, good chart, and strong Bitcoin. The squeezability score is a modest 56% with a juice target of 42.7 in a best-case scenario. Ideally, we would like to see Bitcoin hold over 70k and push higher to help assist sentiment, and we would like to see key resistance levels of 22 and 23 break for indication of further upside trend continuation short-term.

2024-05-20 15:20:12,Bringing back the Accelerator Program CFP,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/defiblockchain/comments/1cwfexd/bringing_back_the_accelerator_program_cfp/,"Edit: German Translation added  
  
Accelerator Overdrive (300.000 DFI)

**Who?**  
Hong & Robin, both longtime members of the community and both part time Youtubers and Crypto enthusiasts. Robin also runs his own Crypto Community: Krypto Wölfe  
I am not gonna use some fancy words to try and sell ourselves. We are just two guys with some ideas trying to make an impact.

**What?**  
We want to bring back the Accelerator Program that was abandoned and raise fundings for new marketing campaigns. A lot of people think the current structure is very confusing and lacks a direction. We want to revamp, restructure, and simplify access to the Defichain and especially to the Metachain.  
Our main goal is to attract people from outside and accelerate the ecosystem. We are in talks with Fabio and the DefichainLabs Team to receive the old Accelerator Team’s Social Media handles. If this proposal gets approved we will officially take over the tasks of the Accelerator Team as no one is currently responsible for that.

**Why?**  
Marketing is a powerful tool. In the world we come from, it is like a currency. It doesn't matter how good your product is, if nobody knows about it. The sentiment has been quite depressed in recent times. More and more projects are leaving the ecosystem. If we do nothing, the downwards trend will only continue.  
We entered the next bull market. Now is the time to act! We have to strike and change the momentum.  
We have the DMC with a lot of projects, a whole new ecosystem that needs to get pushed. We want to attract more people to the Metachain. We want more projects on the Metachain and existing projects to blossom.

**How?**  
Make Defichain fun again and change the momentum and the narrative.

Simplify:  
Defichain has become too complicated. It isn't easy for new people to get into our ecosystem. It starts with the website. It doesn't even feature the DMC projects. How will new people even know about those projects? We need to work together and push each other. As the gap between “pro” and “noob” gets wider and wider we need to bridge that gap better. We need to reach the wider masses a lot better. There needs to be a concentrated and concise hub. A main headquarters where everyone can head to for all the information needed. DMC Universe is a good example of content that should be on our main website. Robin is a big fan of the Hedera website. Compared to that we have a lot of improvements to make.  
-> Revamp the Defichain Website

Restructure:  
We see a lot of people complaining about a lack of direction. We have too many groups and too many links. Things like “Defilinks.io” should be on our main website. We can't expect new people to find all of these websites and links to gather all the information they need. The existing Telegram groups should include more DMC projects and things that happen on the Metachain. We have done a poor job of promoting the Metachain so far. If we use the current ressources better we could bring a lot more attention to the DMC. We can add a new Channel, where all the news and content about the Metachain will be posted. There are so many possibilities to improve and make it easier to acces for everyone.  
-> Restructure our Social Media Infrastructure

Incentivize:  
Last cycle NFT was the buzzword. This time it is Airdrop!  
But Airdrop is just another word for marketing, promotion, learn and earn, giveaway, incentive, bonus, collaboration, onboarding, and many more…  
We want to launch several of these campaigns, all using this Airdrop narrative. We plan to do small Airdrops like giveaways but also bigger Airdrops that will incentivize projects and communities to enter the DMC. New users will get to know the community and the ecosystem. They will have to learn how to use the chain and what they can do with their Airdops. (Swap them on Vanillaswap, put them into pools, buy Dstocks on Javsphere Trade X, buy NFTs on Atlantis (or a new NFT Marketplace as Atlantis announced their exit recently), supply Liquiditiy on Seahorse...)  
-> Incentivize new people to use the DMC

**Duration?**  
Each promo phase will last 3 months. After each Phase/3 months we will propose a new CFP for funding. Unlike the previous Accelerator Program, we try to use a set budget because we are planning on doing a lot of campaigns from small to big. So further funds will only be spent if the community is satisfied with the results. The requested amount for each phase may vary depending on what kind of campaigns are planned.

**Phase 1: Rebirth**  
We want to emphasize that this Accelerator program tries to accelerate the Metachain and the whole ecosystem. No individual project should be favored but some projects are more suitable for marketing campaigns than others. We want to help all DMC projects with marketing and attract new people as well as new projects. If the whole ecosystem thrives, all projects and the community as a whole can profit. More users means more DFI/DUSD demand, more fees, more activity, more attractiveness, and more liquidity.

**Examples:**  
(This was planned before Atlantis announced their exit and can only be executed if the DMC will get a new marketplace)  
**NFT Onboarding:** NFTs are more than just pictures. They are real businesses with entire teams, communities, and utility behind them. Onboarding them is easier than more technical projects who need to build from scratch on the DMC. The entry point is lower. Collab with well established NFT communities and Airdrop to their community.  
e.g. Stoned Ape Crew

https://preview.redd.it/00ece13hsk1d1.jpg?width=1386&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dcd470e6fa8392a8e14f57b9b2e90ca1789f2047

They are one of the Bluechip NFTs on Solana, innovating NFT staking and animation. They have real world utility with their cannabis brand, a utility coin and even a Solana Payment system. Their next project for their NFTs is ""space missions"". A possible collaboration could be a “Deep Sea Mission to find Atlantis” (our NFT Marketplace) They launch a mini NFT collection on DMC with their Astro Helmets:

https://preview.redd.it/3u0cmhnisk1d1.jpg?width=1283&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abbf3c1b8a20c38f9cde856148d82bb971e5dc57

Every holder of one of those Astro Helmet Apes can claim his DMC Astro Helmet Version and with that his Airdrop. We get new people on to the chain, a new NFT collection, more trading volume, people who buy DFI to pay gas fees, people who take a look into our ecosystem to find out what they can do with the rewards from their Airdrop.

Cost: 50.000 - 100.000 per campaign  
Effects: more reach, new users, need for DFI as gas fees, engagement, boost image/appearance

**Community Quest Incentives:**  
Robin had the idea to direct the community's support in a more controlled way. We need a reason for the community to support the community. A quest campaign can create an incentive for the community to complete those small tasks like liking a video or voting for Defichain in some ranking. Each month a Quest campaign with a prize pool (5.000 DFI) starts and will be distributed at the end of the month to the top supporters. This can show the concentrated power of the community to others, as you know it is all about image. New people making videos about Defichain/Metachain will immediately see a huge boost in their statistics which in turn will motivate them to do more videos. It also gives back to people who keep supporting the community.

https://preview.redd.it/0gkfdphytk1d1.jpg?width=1577&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5fa12df529171f2adba335f69af02a4d16947ce

Cost: 5.000 DFI/month = 15.000 DFI  
Effects: give back to the community, demonstrate the strength of the community to others, motivation for content creators, engagement, image boost

**Buybacks:**  
Jello has done an Airdrop promotion and a lot of people in the community were quite impressed with the results and engagement. NFT communities do this a lot. They buy some of their own NFTs and raffle them away. This keeps their supply in check, raises their floor price, engages their community and of course they elevate their social media reach. We can do this with DMC NFTs and all sorts of DMC Coins from time to time.   
Cost: 100-500 DFI per Giveaway Airdrop  
Effects: more reach, new users, engagement

**Holiday Giveaways:**  
Just small promotions for holidays like Lunar New Year, Easter, Halloween, Christmas,...  
Keep the activity going and the ball rolling. Keep people engaged and have some fun.  
Cost: 100-500 DFI per Giveaway Airdrop  
Effects: more reach, new users, engagement

**Outside Marketing:**  
Robin has a lot of experiences as well as a lot of connections. He already has several ideas. Some of his ideas can be seen in the current Javsphere promo campaigns. We definitely plan to represent Defichain/Metachain at Expos as well. A lot of community members want us to be presented at such events and Robin has a lot of connections to organizers. (Robin just came back from a big expo)

**100 Million Incubator Program:**  
We still have the 100 Million Accelerator CFP that went through: [https://t.co/dxQeRahP14](https://t.co/dxQeRahP14)  
Whenever this gets the greenlight by BAKE, we can use this as leverage and promotion fuel to attract a lot of new developers and projects.

There are many more possibilities. These are just some of the examples, as some ideas have not been fine tuned yet. We plan to do a lot: events, paid content, several campaigns, and a lot of social media. A wise man once said, the best ideas come to you at 1 am on a sleepless night, and we don't sleep a lot so the ideas just keep coming. We want the ball to start rolling and to never stop. There should always be something going on, even if it is just a small giveaway. You know very well how fast paced social media and crypto is. Consumers have a short term memory, and we want them to always see us doing something. We want them to always have us in mind.

**How will the funds be spent?**

For this phase we request 300.000 DFI. They will be split into two batches of 200.000 DFI and 100.000 DFI. The 200.000 DFI will be used as marketing budget for all kinds of promotions. The 100.000 DFI will be used as compensation for us. We want to help the Chain but at the same time we know that a lot of time and effort needs to be put into this project. At the current price this equals about 1000$ every month for each of us. We think this is a very fair amount. Our community doesnt have many builders and doers left as building and doing costs time and effort.

**Famous last words:**  
I don't consider myself a Defighter but I consider myself a loyal guy. I owe Defichain a lot and I want to at least try, the same goes for Robin. We don't want to sit on the sidelines and just watch it slowly die, when there are still so many possibilities. Even if we can only make a small impact, at least we tried.

**Deutsch:**  
Im letzten Teil des neuesten Defichain Talks von Puschi könnt ihr einen Einblick von Robin über unsere Gedanken und Motivation bekommen. In Videoformat ist es leichter sich auszudrücken als in Schriftform.  
[Defichain Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGg7gFvONwc)

Accelerator Overdrive (300.000 DFI)

**Wer?**  
Hong & Robin, beide langjährife Mitglieder der Community und beide Teilzeit Youtuber und Krypto Enthusiasten. Robin führt auch seine eigene Krypto Community: Krypto Wölfe  
Ich werde jetzt nicht grossartig versuchen uns zu vermarkten. Wir sind einfach nur 2 Typen mit Ideen die etwas bewirken wollen.

**Was?**  
Wir wollen das Accelerator Programm, das aufgegeben wurde, zurück bringen und Fundings für neue Marketing Kampagnen beantragen. Viele finden die aktuelle Struktur sehr verwirrend und es fehlt vielen an einer klaren Richtung. Wir wollen den Zugang zur defichain und vor allem der Metachain überarbeiten, umstrukturieren und vereinfachen.  
Unser Hauptziel ist es neue Leute von ausserhalb anzuziehen und das Ökosystem zu pushen. Wir sind bereits im Gespräch mit Fabio und dem DefichainLabs Team um die Social Media Konten des alten Accelerator Teams zu übernehmen. Wenn dieser Vorschlag durch kommt, übernehmen wir offiziel die Aufgaben des Accelerator Teams, da sich momentan niemand darum kümmert.

**Warum?**  
Marketing ist ein mächtiges Werkzeug. In unserer Welt ist es wie eine Währung. Es ist egal wie gut ein Produkt ist, wenn es niemand kennt. Die Stimmung in letzter Zeit ist sehr deprimiert. Mehr und mehr Projekte verlassen das Ökosystem. Wenn wir nichts unternehmen, dann wird es nur in eine Richtung weitergehen.  
Der nächste Bullenmarkt hat angefangen. Jetzt ist die Zeit zum Handeln!   
Wir haben jetzt die DMc mit vielen neuen Projekten, ein neues Ökosystem, dass gepushed werden muss. Wir wollen mehr Leute auf die Metachain bringen. Wir wollen, dass die Metachain und alle Projekte dadrauf aufblühen.

**Wie?**  
Die Defichain soll einfach wieder Spass machen und die Stimmung soll sich bessern.

Vereinfachen:  
Defichain ist zu kompliziert geworden. Es ist nicht einfach für neue Leute ihren Fuss in das Ökosystem zu fassen. Es fängt bei der Webseite an, die nicht einmal die DMC Projekte aufzeigt. Wie sollen neue Leute dann von den Projekten überhaupt erfahren? Wir müssen uns gegenseitig unterstützen und pushen. Wir wollen die Brücke zwischen ""Anfänger"" und ""Experte"" schliessen. Wir müssen die breite Masse besser erreichen. Es muss eine konzentrierte und übersichtliche Hauptzentrale geben. Ein Ort wo Leute jegliche Informationen, die sie benötigen, finden können. DMC Universe ist ein gutes Beispiel, so etwas sollte auf der Defichain Webseite zu finden sein. Robin ist ein grosser Fan von der Hedera Webseite. Verglcihen damit, haben wir noch viel Spielraum nach oben.  
-> Defichain Webseite überarbeiten

Umstrukturieren:  
Wir sehen, dass sich viele Leute über eine mangelnde Richtung beschweren. Zu viele Gruppen, zu viele Links. Sachen wie “Defilinks.io” sollten auf die Hauptwebseite. Wir können von neuen Leuten nicht erwarten sich alle Informationen von hier und da zusammen zu finden. Die existierende Telegram Gruppe sollte mehr DMC Projekte und News zur DMC erwähnen. Die Metachain wurde bisher sehr schlecht vermarktet. Wenn wir die verfpgbaren Resourcen besser nutzen, könnten wir viel mehr Aufmerksamkeit auf die DMC bringen. Wir können einen neuen Telegram Channel öfnnen, der sich auf die Metachain konzentriert. Es gibt so viele Möglichkeiten es besser und einfacher zu gestalten.  
-> Defichain Social Media Infrastruktur umstrukturieren

Anreize schaffen:  
Im öetzen Zyklus ging es um NFTs. Dieses mal geht es um Airdrops!  
Aber Airdrop ist nur ein anderer Begriff für Marketing, Promo, Werbe Aktionen, Anreiz, Bonus, Zusammenarbeit und vieles mehr  
Im Grunde genommen ist jegliche Art von Marketing ein Airdrop, da man Geld ausgibt mit der Erwartung Kunden zu gewinnen. Wir wollen mehrere Kampagnen unter der Airdrop Narrative starten. Wir planen kleine Kampagnen, mittel grosse, sowie grössere Kampagnen um Anreize zu schaffen für neue Leute und Communites auf die DMC zu kommen. Neue Nutzer lernen die DMC und das Ökosystem kennen. Sie müssen sich mit den verschiedenen Möglichkeiten auseinandersetzen, was sie mit ihrem Airdrop machen können. (Tauschen auf Vanilla Swap, in Pools stecken, Dstocks auf Javsphere kaufen, NFTs auf Atlantis kaufen (bzw einer neuen Plattform da Atlantis aufhört), Liquidität auf Seahorse zur Vefügung stelllen...)  
-> Anreize schaffen für Leute auf die DMC zu kommen und die Projekte dort zu nutzen

**Dauer?**  
Jede Promo Phase soll 3 Monate dauern. Nach jeder Promohase/3 Monaten soll ein neues CFP für neues Funding gestellt werden. Da wir viele Kampganen planen, von klein bis gross, wollen wir ein festes Marketing Budget benutzen im Gegensatz zum alten Team, dass nur grosse Kampagnen durchgeführt hat und dafür jedes mal ein neues CFP gestellt hat. Weitere Funds sollen nur bereitsgestellt werden wenn die Community zufrieden mit den Ergbnissen ist. Die angefragte Summe variert jedes mal abhängig davon wie gross und aufwendig die geplanten Kampganen sind.

**Phase 1: Wiedergeburt**  
Wir wollen erwähnen, dass das Accelerator Programm die Metchain und das Ökosystem pushen will. Kein einzelnes Projekt soll bevorzugt werden, jedoch gibt es Projekte die sich für Promo Kampgnen eher eignen. Wir wollen jedem Projekt mit Marketing helfen und allgemein Leute auf die DMC bringen. Wenn es dem gesamten Ökosystem gut geht, dann hilft es auch allen Projekten auf der DMC. Mehr Nutzer bedeutet mehr Nachfrage nach DFI/DUSD, mehr Gebühren, mehr Aktivität und mehr Liquidität.

**Beispiele:**  
(Das wurde geplant bevor Atlantis ihren Abgang bekanntgegeben hat, dieses Beispiel ist natürlich nur umsettzbar wenn wir eine NFT PLattform bekommen)

**NFT Onboarding:** NFTs sind mehr als nur Bilder. Es sind gescheite Unternehmen mit tatsächlichen Teams, Communities und Nutzen dahinter. Es ist einfacher solche Projekte auf die DMC zu bringen als Projekte die technisch einen höheren Aufwand benötigen. Der Einstieg für die NFT Projekte ist einfacher. Mit bestehenden NFT Projekten zusammenarbeiten und einen Airdrop für deren Communities stellen um einen Anreiz zu schaffen auf die DMC zu kommen.  
z.B. Stoned Ape Crew

https://preview.redd.it/dytxwnd2192d1.jpg?width=1386&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b7bbb441ff412fcd579a962c1bb2f48c2497e4f

Sie sind einer der krassesten Nfts auf Solana, habe NFT staking & Animation innoviert. SIe haben Real World Utility mit ihrer eigenen Cannabis brand, einen Utility Coin und ihr eigenes Solana Payment System (Payleaf). Ihr nächstes grosses Projekt sind ""Space Missions"". Eine mögliche Kollaborationsidee: ""Deep Sea Mission nach Atlantis"". Sie launchen ihre eigene Mini NFT Kollektion auf der DMC mit ihren Astro Helmen:

https://preview.redd.it/fm9qvoyz092d1.jpg?width=1283&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4b2551ee63d4eee86259b72dad7a4beb2f49c25

Jeder Holder eines Asto Helmet NFT erhält eine DMC Version und einen Airdrop. Wir kriegen neue Leute auf die Chain, eine neue NFT Kollektion, mehr Trading Volumen, Leute die DFI kaufen um Gas Gebühren zu zahlen, und Leute die sich auf der DMC umschauen um heraus zu finden was sie mit ihrem Airdrop alles machen können.  
  
Kosten: 50.000-100.000 DFI pro Kampagne  
Effekt: mehr Reichweite, neue Nutzer, erhöhte Nachfrage für Gas Gebühren, mehr Engagement, Image boost

**Community Quest Anreize:**  
Robin hatte die Idee den Support der Community besser zu lenken und zu fokussieren. Wir brauchen einen Grund für die Community die Community zu supporten. Eine Quest Kampagne kann einen  Anreiz schaffen, dass die Community aktiver supportet und Videos oder Posts mehr liked, öfters für Defichain bei irgendwelchen Wahlen/Umfragen abstimmt usw. Jeden Monat gibt es eine Quest Kampagne mit verschiedenen Aufgaben und einem Preis Pool (5.000 DFI), der am Ende des Monats an die Top Supporter ausgeschüttet wird. Ihr wisst selber, dass Image und Erscheinen sehr wichtig ist. Damit können wir nach Aussen ein sehr positives Image erzeugen, wo andere sehen wir stark die Community ist. Wenn Leute ein Video über die Defichain/Metachain machen, sehen sie sofort eine bessere Performance ihres Videos, was sie wiederum dazu mtiviert mehr Defichain/Metachain Content zu produzieren. Natürlich gibt man so auch ein wenig zurück an die trueen Community Mitglieder.

Kosten: 5.000 DFI pro Monat = 15.000 DFI  
Effekt: belohnt treue Community, mehr Reichweite, mehr Motivation für Content Creator, mehr Engagement, Image boost

**Buybacks:**  
Jello hatte eine Airdrop Kampagne und die Community war überwältigt und beeindruckt von den Ergebnissen. In der NFT Szene ist dies sehr üblich. Man kauft seine eigenen NFTs und verlost diese an die Community. Dies hat natürlich viele positive Auswirkungen. Wir können das selbe mit Coins und NFTs auf der DMC machen.

Kosten: 100-500 DFI pro Kampagne  
Effekt: mehr Reichweite, neue Nutzer, mehr Engagement, Image boost

**Feiertags Gewinnspiele:**  
Einfach nur ein paar Gewinnspiele zu bestimmten Feiertagen oder Anlässen wie Weihnachten, Ostern, Bitcoin Pizza Day usw  
Es soll einfach die Aktivität steigern und die Leute sollen Spass haben. Man soll sehen, dass bei uns immer etwas los ist.

Kosten: 100-500 DFI pro Kampagne  
Effekt: mehr Reichweite, neue Nutzer, mehr Engagement, Image boost

**Outside Marketing:**  
Robin hat eine Menge Erfahrungen und Kontakte. Er hat bereits einige Ideen. Einige davon kann man bereits in den Marketing Kampagnen von Javsphere sehen. Wir planen auch Defichain/Metachain auf Messen zu vertreten, da einige aus der Community sich das wünschen. Robin hat diesbezüglich auch bereits Erfahrungen und Kontakte. (er kam gerade erst von einer grossen Expo)

**100 Million Incubator Program:**  
Wir haben auch noch immer das 100 Million Accelerator CFP: [https://t.co/dxQeRahP14](https://t.co/dxQeRahP14)  
Wenn das freie Fahrt von BAKE erhält, kann man damit natürlich auch einiges an Promo machen um neue Leute und vor allem Developer anzulocken.

Es gibt sehr viele Möglichkeiten die man machen kann. In Marketing gibt es keine goldene Regel die man befolgen muss. Vieles ist ausprobieren und schauen. Das waren jetzt nur ein paar Beispiele von vielen Ideen die wir noch haben, jedoch sind antürlich nicht alle voll ausgearbeitet. Wir planen noch einiges: bezahlter content, Artikel, Social media, Events... Ein Weiser Mann sagte mal: die besten Ideen kommen einem um 1 Uhr Nachts in einer schlaflosen Nacht und wir schlafen sehr wenig. Wir wollen den Ball ins rollen bringen, sodass er gar nicht mehr stoppt. Es soll immer etwas los sein, auch wenn es nur ein kleines Gewinnspiel ist. Ihr wisst alle sehr genau wie schnell lebig die Social Media und Krypto Welt ist. Die Menschen haben ein Kurzeitgedächtnis und wir wollen immer in ihrem Augenwinkel lauern. 

**Wie werden die Funds verwendet?**  
Für diese Promo Phase beantragen wir 300.000 DFI. Die DFI werden in 200.000 DFI und 100.000 DFI aufgeteilt. Die 200.000 DFI werden als Marketing Budget und alle anfallenden Kosten verwendet. Die 100.000 DFI würden wir gerne als Aufwandsentschädigung anfordern. Wir wollen zwar die Chain und Community unterstützen aber wissen zur sleben Zeit, dass dies eine Menge Arbeit wird. Arbeit die bisher niemand anderes machen wollte. Die meisten Macher sind leider weg und nur noch wenige sind da die Tun und ihre Zeit investieren.

**letzte Worte:**  
Ich halte mich nicht für einen Defighter, aber ich halte mich für einen treuen Typen. Ich habe der Defichain eine Menge zu verdanken, dasselbe gilt für Robin. Wir wollen es zumindest versucht habem und nicht untätig danbenstehen und zuschauen wie die Chain langsam stirbt. Auch wenn wir nur wenig bewirken werden, wenigstens haben wir es versucht.",LABEL_1
2024-05-20 15:11:24,SqueezeFinder Update - May 20th 2024,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/1cwf8ba/squeezefinder_update_may_20th_2024/,"Good morning, everyone,

The main tech index $QQQ looks to be enjoying yet another strong morning surging back up over 452, which is helping fuel some green for lots of plays this morning. We have a plethora of Fed speakers throughout the day today. Ideally, we want them all to unanimously cheer progress on inflation and restore faith in rate cuts later this year. $QQQ has 2 main short-term support levels at 450 and then 446 after back-to-back strong sessions from the bulls last week.

$MARA: The King of Bitcoin miners remains on high watch with particular emphasis on a need to break over resistance level of 21 this week to prove it can make a potential squeeze. Bitcoin has been incredibly strong this weekend (pushing back towards 70k+), so it seems logical that eventually we should be able to clear over 21 and make more progress on continuing the uptrend that began the week before their recent blowout earnings report last week. Same support level of 19 from last week needs to be held, otherwise could signal a rejection of 20s, so let's be careful of that in case buyers can't defeat the bears here. Still maintains a 66% squeezability score and a juice target of 42.9 in the best-case scenario with SqzMo (Squeeze Momentum) of 9 signaling a positive trend in the data over the last week.

$FFIE:  Exercise extreme caution entering as meme stocks have been unforgiving the last week after their big runs recently.  Please be careful as the company has stated their inability to file their quarterly earnings in the 10-Q, so we're essentially blind to their financial position, and they very easily could dilute after an incredible rally from 0.04 ➡ \~4 last week, and now pushing back towards 2 in premarket. Main resistance levels to beat for potential continuation are 2 and 2.35, whereas the main support levels to hold are 1.70, 1.50, 1.35, 1.2 and 1.

",44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1cwe6os/im_a_full_time_trader_and_this_is_everything_im/,"**ANALYSIS**:

* If we look at US equities, breadth and positioning supportive. Traders remain very bearish on VIX which means market makers will add liquidity to support equities.

* 5275 is key support on downside looking at positioning. 
* **EURUSD: looks like bullish positioning on EURUSD short term. Skew positive, pointing higher in short term option contracts. Improving in long term too. Positioning supportive on all time frames then. Here we see technicals too, on verge of breakout.**
* [https://imgur.com/a/9Q4hwtp](https://imgur.com/a/9Q4hwtp) 
* **Silver Update: Hit new yearly high again, positioning remains bullish. Still not seeing signs for big pullback here, as IV in options isn't lowering. This is keeping skew v high and pointing to more upside. Skew actually hit a yearly high, which suggests traders still look higher.**
* **Gold update: Skew is still moving higher. Again skew is near a yearly high. Traders continue to seek upside exposure and momentum looks strong. We are seeing calls building on even as high as 2700 lol. Trend v strong with more data coming this week.**
* **Oil positioning still points to potential bounce as oil moves higher slightly in premarket. Positioning has pointed to a bounce for some time even as price has traded flat, so let's see if we get it soon.**
* BTC positioning is supportive: **If we look at options, we see Call interest increasing on 75k. Traders are looking for a breakout. Even bitcoin ETFs showing increasing gamma on high strikes.**

2024-05-20 12:47:11,8 reasons to buy/hold Ethereum in 2024,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1cwcklk/8_reasons_to_buyhold_ethereum_in_2024/,"**1. Resilience despite competition**  

Despite growing competition from Solana and other Layer-1 blockchains, Ethereum remains the leader in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. This dominance demonstrates its robust infrastructure and widespread adoption, which continues to make it a preferred platform for DeFi applications and protocols. Even temporary changing of the guard through meme coin trading on Solana cannot change this.  

**2. Stablecoin dominance**  

Ethereum dominates stablecoin issuance and remains a critical driver of adoption. Even with Solana’s growth, Ethereum Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum are outperforming Solana in terms of stablecoin supply. This superiority highlights Ethereum’s central role in the crypto ecosystem. Because stablecoins are extremely important, especially for institutional investors. 

**3. Unmatched DeFi usage**  

ETH is indispensable as a means of payment in the DeFi sector. Because ETH is crucial as a security for money markets like Maker and Aave and serves as the base unit for many DEX pairs. This central role makes it the first significant liquidity pool and highlights its immense importance in DeFi applications. 

**4. Staking**

Ethereum staking represents a significant source of liquidity. Post-merge, stakers continue to outperform ETH issuance. Unlike Bitcoin miners, ETH stakers are not forced to sell, which minimizes selling pressure. This stability further strengthens Ethereum's position in the market. The tradable supply is becoming scarce and will support increases in value in the future. 

**5. Explosive Layer-2 expansion** 

Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are growing rapidly and use ETH as a gas fee. Over 3.5 million ETH are locked on these Layer 2 networks, providing another significant source of liquidity for Ethereum. This development strengthens the demand for ETH and reduces the available supply. 

**6. Tokenization on Ethereum**  

Major financial institutions prefer Ethereum because of its long-standing reliability. Projects like Blackrock’s BUIDL fund and JPM’s ODA token standard illustrate this trend. This preference demonstrates Ethereum's leadership in asset tokenization and strengthens its position as a trusted platform for institutional applications. Because institutional investors still prefer ETH. 

**7. Burning Ether**  

After switching to Proof of Stake, Ethereum inflation has decreased. Unlike Bitcoin, positive inflation for ETH is not a “structurally important component.” Since staking absorbs much of the newly issued ETH, selling pressure is significantly reduced and scarcity increases. In certain market phases, ETH is even deflationary. 

**8. Impact of ETFs**  

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have strengthened BTC’s status as a macro asset. The same will happen for ETH. Coinbase believes that the launch of a US spot ETH ETF is only a matter of time. The market is underestimating this catalyst, which offers potential for positive surprises. Although there could initially be a rejection in May, sooner or later there will be no way around Ethereum ETFs. 

**Closing statement** 

In conclusion, one can say that Ethereum still has a strong future ahead of it and I am sure that one day we will also see $10k. The crypto market only has a market cap of $2.548 trillion and is therefore a lot smaller than the stock market. As adoption of cryptos increases, we will see a parabolic rise in the market cap.

This transition can be difficult, especially for a newbie crypto user. Well, not to worry, Zypto’s got you covered! Thanks to its user-friendly app and superb community support, Zypto makes handling crypto as easy as using your smartphone.

As digital trends evolve, crypto is continuously integrated into many payment systems. Imagine an app where you can engage in e-shopping, send money to loved ones, or perhaps hold your favorite altcoins or meme coins. Zypto caters to everyone, as it offers a secure payment system and is dedicated to making transactions smooth and fast. 

Ready to know more? Today’s post dives deeper into how Zypto is set to revolutionize the crypto space via its app and token.

# The Zypto App: Your Go-To Platform For Secured Payments

The crypto space has revealed remarkable projects in recent years, with the potential to provide excellent utilities to crypto users. Zypto is the focus today, as it aims to be a breath of fresh air in finance. While many fintech companies focus solely on the blockchain, Zypto recognizes that this tech can confuse newcomers or even pro traders.

As such, this company takes up the mantle by simplifying complex processes and providing accessible resources. Also, they create a welcoming space where users are empowered to explore the potential of cryptocurrency. This is precisely where the Zypto app shines.

Imagine having an app that lets you pay for your groceries with Bitcoin within minutes or send money to a loved one using their mobile number. That’s the future Zypto is building with its flagship app. Here are a few glimpses of what this app offers to savvy users:

* Seamless Crypto Transactions

Having trouble transacting hundreds of cryptos? Zypto app is your one-stop shop for easily buying, selling, and transferring digital assets. You don’t need to bother about gas fees or blockchain interactions. Why? The app, behind the scenes, handles the heavy lifting.

Moreover, Zypto is integrated with multiple blockchain networks. So, users can trade their favorite coins without worrying about network compatibility.

* Supports Easy Payments with Crypto

Beyond transacting, the Zypto app allows you to pay for anything with its integrated payment system. Zypto Pay utilizes the latest technology to ensure transactions are processed and secured. Therefore, you can use the app to pay for coffee or your favorite gadget online. It is as easy as when you swipe your debit cards at a payment counter.

* Bridges The Gap for Fiat Payments 

Many merchants are still not accepting crypto which is often a headache for mobile users. Fortunately, the app is integrated with smooth on-ramp and off-ramp solutions, making it absolutely easy for users to convert their crypto to fiat. 

So, you are covered with your daily purchases and can convert to fiat currency whenever needed. Low on crypto holdings? You can easily fund your wallet with the app.

These are just a few perks of using the Zypto app, which aims to make crypto bill payments easy and seamless. Despite still being in its Beta phase, the app is showing remarkable progress. The development team is putting the finishing touches, and the Zypto app will be officially launched on Tuesday, May 21, 2024, on Android and iOS platforms.

# The Zypto Token ($ZYPTO) That Powers the Ecosystem

Zypto introduces its native token, $ZYPTO, to power its ecosystem, including its app. Holding $ZYPTO tokens provides users access to premium features and rewards. These perks make the token valuable for users and investors seeking to invest in Zypto’s future. Consider a few of them below:

* $ZYPTO Holders Club

As a token holder, you can join the inner cycle and become eligible for rewards based on your holdings and the potential growth of the ecosystem. You can also enjoy discounts and cashback on Zypto Pay transactions, underscoring the platform’s commitment to rewarding token holders.

The more $ZYPTO held, the more benefits received. In addition, you can be rewarded with limited-edition NFTs.

* Interaction with The Zyptoverse

Zypto is building its metaverse to onboard Web 3.0 enthusiasts and gamers. This virtual world will be accessed via $ZYPTO, offering numerous play-to-earn games. These games will reward players and interested users for their skills and participation. 

The Zypto NFTs will play a key role, as holders can enjoy exclusive in-game perks and customization options. Notably, the Zyptoverse is still under development, but we can expect its rollout after the launch of the Zypto app.

Interestingly, Zypto is also building its blockchain network to address high fees and slow transaction times. We can expect $ZYPTO tokens to power this network and provide the best crypto experience. It is equally important to note that ZYPTO tokens are available on numerous exchanges at about $0.03 per token.

# Embrace The Zypto Community United by Innovation

A powerful technology without a community can be useless. Zypto understands and recognizes that fact. The platform now fosters a collaborative environment where users can learn, share ideas, and contribute to the future of finance.

Furthermore, the platform incentivizes users to complete community and social tasks, refer friends, and engage in earning ZYPs (in-app points). Upon accumulation, individuals can redeem these ZYPs for cashback, discounts on in-app purchases, and more. 

According to the whitepaper, community members who hold FrenchFellas NFT will be granted exclusive privileges in the Zypto Universe. The Zypto team continues to engage with the community on social media.

With over 4,000 users on social platforms, Zypto onboards them to a world of easy payments with crypto. To engage with the team and developers, look out for weekly AMAs and live Q&A sessions.

If you don't know this and you're not in on it then you're the victim

Let me explain:

Most crypto projects have founders which mostly start the project sometimes with as little as just an idea.

They create the token which they explain it's purpose to exist called tokenomics.

Then the real work and strategy begins **MARKETING**

As long as you know the right people on CT or VC's you can have an easy time marketing your project. Nothing like a good old token distribution plan to compensate people shilling their token. Thus more insiders for the team which are now all interested in making the price of the token rise.

After the token distribution and prob some buying to make the price look like it's starting to rise, the shilling commences. Backed by **MARKETING**

People on twitter see Wizz & Kaduna etc shilling the token and they buy it.

After that people need to buy from easier places like exchanges.

Exchange pressure commences, followed by another token distribution to XYZ exchanges interested to get in on the action.

A bit more marketing and you starting to see Adds on twitter articles etc.

Now that there's nice liquidity on the exchanges, the real game commences.

So now that your token is trending, and you get nice fat bags you start selling more getting those millions stacked. You continue with the marketing strategy for the liquidity required for the insiders to exit.

Pay a little more to CTs to pump up the hype articles talking about it, Price targets, ""supposed partnerships with Apple or Google"" whatnot.

Once the price starts to dump you reduce the marketing but still making the hopes up for the little fish invested in it. and you continue to sell as much as you can.

**If you see Kaduna & others still giving hopes up about his shill even tho the price is dumping he's probably not in on it, he was paid to give hopes not hold the token.**

# Now you're rich what now?

Now Here's tree options:

Revive the token with your liquidity and start the marketing engine again with the promisse of reaching ATH again.

Or You start a new project all over again but now you have more liquidity eaier time!

Or you go live life at it's fullest.

**There's a very little percentage of people who made tremendous amounts of money from these schemes and most of them were insiders who knew the game not regular degen investors.**

If you still have hope for crypto projects pick those who can emmulate bitcoin & ethereum path",LABEL_1
2024-05-14 15:07:11,Time for a new bullish narrative: “Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs Hit by Record Outflows; $32M Withdrawn in 1 Day”,34,https://coinedition.com/hong-kong-bitcoin-etfs-hit-by-record-outflows-32m-withdrawn-in-1-day/?utm_source=telegram_channel&utm_medium=referral,"
“Hong Kong’s six spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced their largest net outflows of $38 million on Monday since their inception on April 30.

The trio of spot Bitcoin ETFs, managed by China Asset Management (ChinaAMC), Harvest, and the partnership of Bosera and HashKey, witnessed a substantial outflow of 519.5 BTC on Monday, valued at over $32 million. This figure contrasts with the 99.99 BTC outflow observed on Friday, as per the analytics from SosoValue.

Leading the exodus was ChinaAMC’s spot bitcoin ETF, which saw 251.65 BTC withdrawn.  Following closely was Harvest’s ETF at 147.86 BTC and Bosera HashKey’s ETF at 119.99 BTC. As of Monday, these ETFs collectively held approximately 3,560 BTC, with their total net assets diminishing to $219.7 million from Friday’s $262.7 million, SosoValue reported.

The Ethereum side of the market echoed this trend, with the three spot ETFs also marking their highest daily net outflows to date. A total of 2,270 ETH was withdrawn on Monday, a notable increase from zero flows on Friday and an outflow of 471.25 ETH on Thursday. In monetary terms, these Ethereum ETFs faced a total net outflow of $6.6 million on Monday, according to Farside’s data.

Meanwhile, the bleeding trend observed in the Hong Kong crypto spot ETF market contrasts with the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market development. As of Monday, U.S. ETF saw a positive flow of $66 million led by Fidelity’s FBTC. This positive flow emerged after two conservative trading days of negative flows.”

Could this be the tipping point we've been waiting for?  It seems like every day, another big player announces their investment in BTC.

With this trend gaining momentum, I can't help but wonder if we're on the brink of a historic shift. Imagine a world where every major corporation holds Bitcoin. And let's not forget about the upcoming supply shock from the halving. 

I'm bullish on Bitcoin, to say the least. Personally, I wouldn't be surprised to see BTC surpass $300,000 in the near future. But I'm curious to hear what you all think. Are we truly on the verge of a Bitcoin boom, or am I just getting ahead of myself?",LABEL_2

* What can we say about the market scenario right now, going into a very important CPI week?
* Liquidity is high in the market, and is showing very little signs of stress right now. Traders remain long the market, and are short on volatility. This is ensuring that pullbacks get bought as liquidity is high. 
* Right now, we see very little cause for much concern. I had the question recently about some speculation from some X users saying they are seeing put gamma building in the option chain to suggest there are signs of a downturn coming. This is not the correct interpretation of the put gamma we see. This whole rally up, since November, and especially around the time of Israel Iran scenario, we have seen put gamma remain on the option chain because traders have been trying to call an eventual pullback. Trying to get ahead of it, thinking that the market is overextended. To be honest, yes, the market has had a crazy run. But these people trying to get ahead of the pullback, has just caused more squeeze higher as data and market moves haven’t followed. E.g. If CPI comes soft this week, all of this put gamma will have to be closed or will expire worthless, which means that it will fuel a more extreme push higher. This will probably move us to ATH soon. This is the type of scenario that has got us to near 5300 on SPX. So the put gamma is nothing o be looked into in terms of bearish signal.
* Skew for MAG7 stocks remains at ATH. Default Swaps remain very low. Right now we are not seeing positioning for a market ready for a sustained pullback, but in fact are showing signs of a market ready for new ATH. 
* If we see a pullback from CPI coming hot, it likely will not last unless it is extremely hot. This is because Powell has already mentioned that there is basically no chance of another hike. Traders remain very short vol. If CPI comes hot, its probable we see a short term spike in VIX, and a jump in dollar, but then the VIX spike will get faded as traders sell into the volatility, which will trigger a buy the dip. 
* Right now traders are hedging, but are not positioned for a sustained pullback. Skew is elevated but pointing downwards. This means traders are overall bullish but are seeing short term risks Skew on short term is pointing lower but on 3m points to new highs. Traders may see potential a short term dip from CPI, but for it to not disrupt the bullishness of the market beyond the ver immediate term as they suspect any dip will be bought. 
* This hedging is particularly on IWM as it is more interest rate sensitive as we see skew point lower. Traders are lowering call options but this is normal ahead of key data. It is just hedging it is not sign of a change in positioning. 
* 200 will probably be the supportive wall on IWM on pullback. 
* Here we see the positioning for delta
* [https://imgur.com/a/zXV6eL6](https://imgur.com/a/zXV6eL6)
* We see a lot of put delta at 200 which will make it supportive, then again at 196 which will probs mark max low incase of v hot print. 
* Traders are still v bullish in this market, as are institutions. They just hedge. 
* A hot CPI will probably lead to a short term pullback, and I will suspect many people will overestimate the magnitude of this and will turn bearish. They will then get fucked again in the buy the dip just like last time. I will update you nearer the time, but this seems the scenario. 
* If CPI comes in line, or soft, we probably rip to ATH, as this will fuel more rate cut sentiment. 
* We will then have CPI soft, as well as jobs numbers softening. 
* I think that the CPI numbers are actually less important right now. We are still yet to see the inflation trend necessary to give the Fed the confidence required to get to cuts. This will likely take many months to get to that point. SO a hot print doesnt change too much in that way, and a soft print still needs a lot more to follow to increase confidence beyond that. 
* However, Powell also laid out the other path to rate cuts, which is that the job market will weaken. 
* Right now, we are seeing many signs of a weaker job market, although it is not weak enough to be at recessionary levels. This is actually right now then in a. Sweet spot. May be weakening enough to push the Fed to still consider cuts, but not weak enough to be recessionary. 
* If we look at the indeed wage growth numbers, Indeed being a private job listing site, we see wage growth over 2023 and into 2024 has continued to move lower. JOLTS is showing a direct Correlation with this. The Indeed data is leading JOLTS lower, so we should expect to see further weakening in the labour market. 
* A look at NVDA positioning: just below the key level of 900. 
* We are seeing positive gex across the board really, not much put gex. Gamma is building on 1000 again. Traders probably look for more upside here. 
* Reaction to PPI probably be limited as traders await CPI. IF good, can see short term jump before faded intraday into CPI. 
* Headline CPI and PPI should get benefit from the fact that oil prices are lower into May from start of April. Used cars should come light on CPI, and we still hope for the shelter prices to reflect real time rents that we see from Zillow data. I think its possible CPI can beat expectations. 



DATA LEDE:

* China Inflation rate: comes 0.3% YOY vs expectations of 0.1%. Previous reading was 0.1%
* As such, China inflation rate was higher than expected. This is bullish for Chinese market as represents another step away from disinflation. 3rd month in a row, out of disinflation.

* Fed’s Jefferson speaks as well as Fed’s Mester

* With QQQ above 440 and SPX above 5200, vol structure is supportive. 
* These are now key levels of support
* We probably see some choppiness, likely with upward pressure as positioning supportive. The choppiness will come from amrket makers tryingt o hedge their volatility surpression. 
* Vix is at 13.37, likely to remain between 13 and 14. 
* We see basically bullihs positioning on indices.
* However, skew on SPX and QQQ, whilst elevated (indicating bulishness) is pointing lower as traders start to hedge. Meanwhile, skew on VIX is supressed, pointing to lack of fear in market, but points higher. This is due to traders hedging for CPI and PPI.
* As such, traders hedge a bit,due to the data, but positioning overall bullish. 
* Top options being bought are 5400 and QQQ 450. both are v much OTM but it shows traders positioning is bullish. Just with hedging for possible short term vol.

Trying to get ahead of it, thinking that the market is overextended. To be honest, yes, the market has had a crazy run. But these people trying to get ahead of the pullback, has just caused more squeeze higher as data and market moves haven’t followed. E.g. If CPI comes soft this week, all of this put gamma will have to be closed or will expire worthless, which means that it will fuel a more extreme push higher. This will probably move us to ATH soon. This is the type of scenario that has got us to near 5300 on SPX. So the put gamma is nothing o be looked into in terms of bearish signal.
* Skew for MAG7 stocks remains at ATH. Default Swaps remain very low. Right now we are not seeing positioning for a market ready for a sustained pullback, but in fact are showing signs of a market ready for new ATH. 
* If we see a pullback from CPI coming hot, it likely will not last unless it is extremely hot. This is because Powell has already mentioned that there is basically no chance of another hike. Traders remain very short vol. If CPI comes hot, its probable we see a short term spike in VIX, and a jump in dollar, but then the VIX spike will get faded as traders sell into the volatility, which will trigger a buy the dip. 
* Right now traders are hedging, but are not positioned for a sustained pullback. Skew is elevated but pointing downwards. This means traders are overall bullish but are seeing short term risks Skew on short term is pointing lower but on 3m points to new highs. Traders may see potential a short term dip from CPI, but for it to not disrupt the bullishness of the market beyond the ver immediate term as they suspect any dip will be bought. 
* This hedging is particularly on IWM as it is more interest rate sensitive as we see skew point lower. Traders are lowering call options but this is normal ahead of key data. It is just hedging it is not sign of a change in positioning. 
* 200 will probably be the supportive wall on IWM on pullback. 
* Here we see the positioning for delta
* [https://imgur.com/a/zXV6eL6](https://imgur.com/a/zXV6eL6)
* We see a lot of put delta at 200 which will make it supportive, then again at 196 which will probs mark max low incase of v hot print. 
* Traders are still v bullish in this market, as are institutions. They just hedge. 
* A hot CPI will probably lead to a short term pullback, and I will suspect many people will overestimate the magnitude of this and will turn bearish. They will then get fucked again in the buy the dip just like last time. I will update you nearer the time, but this seems the scenario. 
* If CPI comes in line, or soft, we probably rip to ATH, as this will fuel more rate cut sentiment. 
* We will then have CPI soft, as well as jobs numbers softening. 
* I think that the CPI numbers are actually less important right now. We are still yet to see the inflation trend necessary to give the Fed the confidence required to get to cuts. This will likely take many months to get to that point. SO a hot print doesnt change too much in that way, and a soft print still needs a lot more to follow to increase confidence beyond that. 
* However, Powell also laid out the other path to rate cuts, which is that the job market will weaken. 
* Right now, we are seeing many signs of a weaker job market, although it is not weak enough to be at recessionary levels. This is actually right now then in a. Sweet spot. May be weakening enough to push the Fed to still consider cuts, but not weak enough to be recessionary. 
* If we look at the indeed wage growth numbers, Indeed being a private job listing site, we see wage growth over 2023 and into 2024 has continued to move lower. JOLTS is showing a direct Correlation with this. The Indeed data is leading JOLTS lower, so we should expect to see further weakening in the labour market. 
* A look at NVDA positioning: just below the key level of 900. 
* We are seeing positive gex across the board really, not much put gex. Gamma is building on 1000 again. Traders probably look for more upside here. 
* Reaction to PPI probably be limited as traders await CPI. IF good, can see short term jump before faded intraday into CPI. 
* Headline CPI and PPI should get benefit from the fact that oil prices are lower into May from start of April. Used cars should come light on CPI, and we still hope for the shelter prices to reflect real time rents that we see from Zillow data. I think its possible CPI can beat expectations. 

DATA LEDE:

* China Inflation rate: comes 0.3% YOY vs expectations of 0.1%. Previous reading was 0.1%

2024-05-13 14:33:40,Everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 13/05 including positioning analysis going into a big data week. ,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingEdge/comments/1cqy6h1/everything_im_watching_and_analysing_in_premarket/,"ANALYSIS

Positioning for Today:

*  With QQQ above 440 and SPX above 5200, vol structure is supportive. 
* These are now key levels of support
* We probably see some choppiness, likely with upward pressure as positioning supportive. The choppiness will come from amrket makers tryingt o hedge their volatility surpression. 
* Vix is at 13.37, likely to remain between 13 and 14. 
* We see basically bullihs positioning on indices.
* However, skew on SPX and QQQ, whilst elevated (indicating bulishness) is pointing lower as traders start to hedge. Meanwhile, skew on VIX is supressed, pointing to lack of fear in market, but points higher. This is due to traders hedging for CPI and PPI.
* As such, traders hedge a bit,due to the data, but positioning overall bullish. 
* Top options being bought are 5400 and QQQ 450. both are v much OTM but it shows traders positioning is bullish. Just with hedging for possible short term vol. 

Will be posting more positioning analysis charts for various instruments on my subreddit r/Tradingedge during the day. Please check back, as it will give you more indication on how markets are positioned. 

* What can we say about the market scenario right now, going into a very important CPI week?
* Liquidity is high in the market, and is showing very little signs of stress right now. Traders remain long the market, and are short on volatility. This is ensuring that pullbacks get bought as liquidity is high. 
* Right now, we see very little cause for much concern. I had the question recently about some speculation from some X users saying they are seeing put gamma building in the option chain to suggest there are signs of a downturn coming. This is not the correct interpretation of the put gamma we see. This whole rally up, since November, and especially around the time of Israel Iran scenario, we have seen put gamma remain on the option chain because traders have been trying to call an eventual pullback. Trying to get ahead of it, thinking that the market is overextended. To be honest, yes, the market has had a crazy run.

This will probably move us to ATH soon. This is the type of scenario that has got us to near 5300 on SPX. So the put gamma is nothing o be looked into in terms of bearish signal.

Traders remain very short vol. If CPI comes hot, its probable we see a short term spike in VIX, and a jump in dollar, but then the VIX spike will get faded as traders sell into the volatility, which will trigger a buy the dip.

2024-05-12 20:18:09,"$KENDU on ETH is now poised to be a top 10 memecoin this cycle. If you get in now, you’re still early. Here’s why…",35,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1cqe7c6/kendu_on_eth_is_now_poised_to_be_a_top_10/,"Despite experiencing double-digit gains in the past 10 days, there are still many reasons why further price appreciation is inevitable, making Kendu a strong buy for new holders:  


  
Holder Growth: Kendu's holder growth is entering a parabolic phase with no signs of slowing down. With approximately 3500 holders already pushing Kendu to a $50M market cap, and as the holder count increases to 10k, 25k, and beyond, it's mathematically impossible for the market cap not to rise. This growth is organic, without paid marketing, and most of the early buyers have decided to hold onto their tokens until the market cap reaches >$1B.  


  
Conversion Rate: Kendu boasts a remarkable 90.6% conversion rate, meaning that nearly nine out of ten people joining the Telegram community end up buying Kendu. This high conversion rate, coupled with the strong conviction of holders and the absence of whale dumping, suggests significant potential for price appreciation. This, along with its holders' work ethic, as described by Miazaki, enable Kendu to be ""infinitely scalable.  


  
Partnership with Shiba Inu's Lead Dev: Kendu's association with Shiba Inu's lead developer, Shytoshi, is gaining momentum. Shytoshi recently joined Kendu's Telegram group and committed to having his team publish an article about Kendu in the SHIB Magazine. While false claims of Shytoshi's partnerships are common in the crypto space, his endorsement of Kendu, verified by an OG Shiba holder and Reddit mod ""StaySeaArt,"" says a lot about the legitimacy of Kend and the reputation of it's dev (Miazaki) of keeping his promises. Shytoshi has hinted at a broader partnership in the future, although specific details are yet to be revealed.  


  
Whale Activity: Whales have only recently started buying Kendu, indicating a growing confidence in the project's legitimacy. Typically more risk-averse, whales tend to wait for a project to gain credibility before investing heavily.  


  
Bitcoin and Ethereum Trends: The current bull cycle has not seen significant movements from Bitcoin and Ethereum yet. As these major tokens gain momentum, the entire market, including Kendu, is likely to benefit from increased value.  


  
TLDR;  
Holder Growth  
Conversion Rate  
Scalability and Marketing

**ANALYSIS**:

* If we look at US equities, breadth and positioning supportive. Traders remain very bearish on VIX which means market makers will add liquidity to support equities. 
* 5300 still key level. 5330 is a big intraday barrier to break looking at positioning
* 5275 is key support on downside looking at positioning. 
* **EURUSD: looks like bullish positioning on EURUSD short term. Skew positive, pointing higher in short term option contracts. Improving in long term too. Positioning supportive on all time frames then. Here we see technicals too, on verge of breakout.**
* [https://imgur.com/a/9Q4hwtp](https://imgur.com/a/9Q4hwtp) 
* **Silver Update: Hit new yearly high again, positioning remains bullish. Still not seeing signs for big pullback here, as IV in options isn't lowering. This is keeping skew v high and pointing to more upside. Skew actually hit a yearly high, which suggests traders still look higher.**
* **Gold update: Skew is still moving higher. Again skew is near a yearly high. Traders continue to seek upside exposure and momentum looks strong. We are seeing calls building on even as high as 2700 lol. Trend v strong with more data coming this week.**
* **Oil positioning still points to potential bounce as oil moves higher slightly in premarket. Positioning has pointed to a bounce for some time even as price has traded flat, so let's see if we get it soon.**
* BTC positioning is supportive: **If we look at options, we see Call interest increasing on 75k. Traders are looking for a breakout. Even bitcoin ETFs showing increasing gamma on high strikes.**

# Risks and Important Information

No Advice on Investment; Risk of Loss: Prior to making any investment decision, each investor must undertake its own independent examination and investigation, including the merits and risks involved in an investment, and must base its investment decision—including a determination whether the investment would be a suitable investment for the investor—on such examination and investigation.

Crypto assets are digital representations of value that function as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but they do not have legal tender status. Crypto assets are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not currently backed nor supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies, stocks, or bonds.

Trading in crypto assets comes with significant risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks and risk of losing principal or all of your investment. In addition, crypto asset markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing.

Crypto asset trading requires knowledge of crypto asset markets. In attempting to profit through crypto asset trading, you must compete with traders worldwide. You should have appropriate knowledge and experience before engaging in substantial crypto asset trading. Crypto asset trading can lead to large and immediate financial losses. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position quickly at a reasonable price.

The opinions expressed represent an assessment of the market environment at a specific time and are not intended to be a forecast of future events, or a guarantee of future results, and are subject to further discussion, completion and amendment. The information herein is not intended to provide, and should not be relied upon for, accounting, legal or tax advice, or investment recommendations.

2024-05-08 20:12:24,Anybody else notice MSTR trends tend to be a Bitcoin price forecaster?,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSTR/comments/1cnbax7/anybody_else_notice_mstr_trends_tend_to_be_a/,"I've noticed (especially on a 10 minute level) that MSTR tends to move a lot in advance of bitcoin moves either way.  For example, last week when MSTR lost 17% but bitcoin only lost 4% just before bitcoin dropped from 60k to 56k.  Then, when Bitcoin dropped to a low of 56k before bouncing back, MSTR hardly dropped much more at all.  I don't have an intraday pulse on bitcoin, but I suspect the true bid and offer for any size is around $500 apart.  Perhaps some mstr traders can see whether a $500 drop is merely a seller vs. a buyer as opposed to other $500 drops when the bid and offer is dropping.  Any thoughts?",LABEL_1
2024-05-08 19:33:49,"Will Standard Chartered stick to its previous predictions of $8,000 ETH in 2024 and $14,000 ETH in 2025?",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1cnadzb/will_standard_chartered_stick_to_its_previous/,"If you don't remember, let me remind you that Standard Chartered predicted $8,000 per ETH and $150,000 per BTC by 2024-end.

[According to this Coindesk post](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/11/ether-could-hit-8k-by-end-of-2026-standard-chartered/), which was published on October 11, 2023:

At its current level, just below $1,600, the price of ether (ETH) could reach $8,000 by the end of 2026, said Geoff Kendrick, who is Head of Crypto Research and EM FX West at Standard Chartered. He predicted $4,000 per ETH by 2024.

2024-05-07 03:42:26,"E-commerce Industry News Recap 🔥 Week of May 6th, 2024",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1cm06r5/ecommerce_industry_news_recap_week_of_may_6th_2024/,"Hi r/ecommerce \- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Each week I post a summary recap of the week's top stories, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in...
___
**Amazon** is delaying its controversial new low inventory fee for the second time as it looks to satiate the hundreds of thousands of sellers it outraged with the original announcement. The company announced via its seller forum that it would be extending the grace period through May 14th. In addition to the delay, Amazon made some general changes to the upcoming fee structure such as the fee will not apply to products that have sold fewer than 20 units in the last week, any fees incurred due to excessive inbounding and processing times caused by Amazon will be refunded, and Amazon will provide an exception to the fee on products that are part of Prime-exclusive sales for the four weeks following Prime Day.
___
**Shein** has been courting brands like Colgate-Palmolive, Hasbro, Suntory Beverage & Food, and Bella Aurora in an attempt to sell more household names on its platform. The company, which is known for selling its own cheap clothing and accessories, is moving into other categories like beauty and household items to better compete with Amazon on its turf. So far Shein has given brands and retailers access to its platform in nine European countries, United States, Brazil and Mexico. Shein says that the inspiration for adding new categories is that customers were already searching for those types of products and brands across its platform.
___
**Kohl's** is re-entering the same-day delivery business — this time leveraging the Instacart app and its network of drivers. The company says that Instacart enables 109M US households to obtain delivery in as fast as an hour from 1,172 Kohl's stores across the U.S. Customers ordering Kohl's deliveries on Instacart can still earn their Kohl's Rewards loyalty points, as well as place orders for either same-day or scheduled delivery, with the same prices as in-store. Product categories eligible for same-day delivery include accessories, home goods, beauty & skincare items, and pet supplies.
___
As part of its mission to enhance its e-commerce business, **Nordstrom** introduced a new digital marketplace on its website, initially showcasing a selection of products from Mulberry, Adore Me, Cynthia Rowley, and DXL. This move catches Nordstrom up to retailers like Macy's, Walmart, and Michaels, which have all created third-party marketplaces in recent years. As opposed to casting a wide net, Nordstrom is being very particular about which sellers to allow on its marketplace, carefully selecting brand partners “to ensure that our marketplace experience drives the relevance and inspiration that Nordstrom customers expect from us.”
___
**Walmart** is now able to sell physical goods directly to users inside **Roblox** for the first time. The introduction of real-life e-commerce of tangible items is a milestone for Roblox, which aims to become an all-encompassing destination for virtual life. Virtual users are greeted with a new storefront that showcases virtual copies of physical items sold at real-life Walmart stores. The customer can try out the virtual item on their avatar. Customers can then load a virtual browser window inside Roblox that imitates the experience of shopping on Walmart's website. From there they follow the traditional form of entering their payment and shipping details within the virtual checkout. (Missed opportunity! They should have had the virtual avatar fumble with a self-checkout kiosk while an angry Walmart employee avatar stares them down. LOL)
___
**Roblox** also expanded access to its video ad inventory to all advertisers last week, following a six-month beta test. Advertisers can now purchase video ads through Roblox's self-serve tool, with plans to allow advertisers to purchase ads through PubMatic in the near future. Video ads in Roblox take the form of screens and billboards embedded within Roblox’s virtual worlds. The launch of video ads is part of Roblox’s aim to get brands to view it as a full advertising platform rather than a testing ground for their innovation budgets.
___
**Amazon** reported its first-quarter earnings last week and it turns out the company is doing really well. CEO Andy Jassy and CFO Brian Olsavsky informed investors of several company milestones on its recent earnings call such as tripling its profit from $3.2B to $10.4B in the same period YoY. Net sales at its online store rose 7% to $54.7B and at physical stores rose 6.3% to $5.2B. Ad sales overall rose 24% to $11.8B. 
___
**Walmart** is planning to close all 51 of its health centers across five states, changing course from its originally stated plan of expanding to 75 locations this year. The company also plans to end its telehealth services, citing operational costs and reimbursement complexities that made its healthcare business unsustainable. All centers stopped accepting new patients last week, however, Walmart said it would continue to care for existing patients during the transition, as well as help its healthcare associates transition to other roles as it winds down the business. The company plans on keeping open its 3,000 vision centers and 4,600 pharmacies, which will continue to offer health screenings and testing.
___
**Amazon**, **Starbucks**, and **McDonald's** executives say US consumers are becoming more prudent with their spending — now looking for deals, seeking lower priced items, and being more particular about where they spend their money. Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said, “We continue to feel the impact of a more cautious consumer, particularly with our more occasional customer,” noting that it had affected traffic and sales across the industry. “Many customers are being more exacting about where and how they choose to spend their money, particularly with stimulus savings mostly spent.” (Mostly spent? LOL. How long does he think that $1200 lasted?) Or maybe the true story is that consumers have ALWAYS been prudent with their spending, and these corporations simply took their price increases too far so people went elsewhere? Maybe the country is NOT headed into a recession and we're all just sick of your price gouging?
___
**Travis Hess** is joining **BigCommerce** as the company's new president, charged with leading its global strategic and operational expansion. Hess has spent more than 15 years in senior leadership positions at e-commerce companies, most recently as managing director of Accenture, and he's also served on partner advisory boards for Shopify, Klaviyo, SAP/Hybrid, and Rackspace.
___  
**Social media** overtook paid search as the world's largest advertising channel, with Western platforms growing the fastest driven by Chinese brands targeting US and European audiences. Social media ads are forecasted to reach $247.3B this year, up 14.3% from a year ago, with TikTok estimated to earn $23.1B of that.
___
**16% of U.S. parents** surveyed said their Gen Alpha children have an online-shopping addiction, with 22% saying their kids prefer online shopping to other forms of entertainment including watching TV. Almost half said their kids buy themselves clothes online, and 32% said their kids are interested in beauty products. Sounds to me like 16% of U.S. parents could use a lesson on parenting. 
___  
**TikTok** said in its latest safety report that it blocked 37M attempted product listings and 2M seller registrations from July to December 2023. The company said it also remove 133k individual products after they were listed on the site and deactivated the accounts of more than one million sellers because of policy violations.
  ___
**Wix** launched a new feature called Wix Proposals that helps users create attractive proposals to convert leads into new clients, collect digital signatures, and manage setting up payments. The feature is powered by the Prospero business proposal platform, which is now integrated directly with Wix’s business management tools.
  ___
**The Canada Revenue Agency** wants to obtain large troves of Shopify merchant information including bank account info, total transaction value, birth dates, and social insurance numbers in order to check if they've paid all their taxes. Shopify has been fighting the “outrageous” request for over a year now, also arguing that it doesn't keep much of the requested information on hand, which the CRA doesn't believe.
  ___
**Sam's Club** is turning to AI to speed up the process of exiting its stores, allowing customers who pay either at a register or through the Scan & Go mobile app to walk out of the store through large scanners instead of having their purchases double-checked manually by employees. Since unveiling the technology this past January, Sam's Club deployed the scanners at over 120 stores in the US, with plans to expand to all its stores by the end of the year.
  ___
**Kajabi**, the platform for content creators to sell online courses, launched a no-code mobile app offering that lets users host their own customized native app through the App Store and Google Play. The platform previously offered a mobile app for hosting online courses, but this new product allows creators to control the user experience, send push notifications, add custom links to the menus, offer in-app purchases, and more.
  
___
  
**Federal prosecutors** are investigating the internal practices at Block, with suspicions that its subsidiary Square processed thousands of transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions as well as multiple crypto transactions for terrorist groups. Most of the transactions discussed with prosecutors were not reported to the government as required, and Block did not correct the company processes when it was alerted to the issues.
  
___
  
Speaking of **Block**, the company announced its strategy of regularly purchasing Bitcoin for its corporate balance sheet using a dollar cost averaging strategy. The company plans to allocate 10% of its monthly gross profit from Bitcoin products towards investments in the cryptocurrency itself.
  
___
  
**The Save Mart Companies** which operates Save Mart, Lucky, and FoodMaxx grocery stores, is deploying Instacart Caper Carts, which use computer vision and AI to automatically identify items as they are placed in the cart, at select Save Mart and Lucky stores in the coming months, followed by a broader rollout later this year. The company is also implementing the Instacart FoodStorm order management system, which enables Caper Cart customers to place orders for made-to-order items like fried chicken or custom cakes and pies directly on the cart screen while they shop and receive a notification once it's ready. 
  
___
  
**ToysRUs.co.uk** is seeking a partner for its e-commerce site, which launched in 2022. The company confirmed to suppliers that it is “transitioning to a non-transactional website” as it seeks a new e-commerce partner, but that the website will “continue to promote the Toys R Us brand including our much-loved mascot Geoffrey, while also fully supporting the opening of TOys R Us stores at WHSmith throughout the UK.” Really Toys R Us — an e-commerce partner? Haven't you been down that road before and been majorly burned?
  ___

  
**Carvana**, the online used car retailer, told investors on an earnings call that it became the most profitable public automotive retailer in the US for the first time after setting new all-time company record this past quarter. The record performance impacted its inventory, with the average time from posting a vehicle on its website to a customer purchasing it decreasing to 13 days in March.
  

 ___ 
**Sam Ash Music**, the 100-year-old family operated music instruments retailer, is closing all 42 of its remaining stores nationwide. The company noted on its website that the “unfortunate news also presents a fantastic opportunity for great deals” and marked down all of its products with sale prices that are still higher than what you can buy the same products for on Amazon right now.
  

  
**Rue21** filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for its third time in the past twenty years and began the process of closing all 540 of its stores. The company has assets worth up to $500M and liabilities of almost an equal amount, according to its submitted documents. Sounds like a great acquisition target for Overstock! LOL. 
  
___
  
A professor from Columbia University asked US courts to affirm the legality of **Unfollow Everything 2.0**, a browser extension that makes it easier to stop following friends, groups, and pages on Facebook. The lawsuit seeks a declaration that the browser extension does not violate Meta's TOS, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or California's Computer Data access and Fraud Act, also arguing that through Section 230, US lawmakers sought “to promote the development of filtering tools that enable users to curate their online experiences and avoid content they would rather not see.” The developer of the original Unfollow Everything was banned from Facebook in 2021 and never released version 2.0 because Meta threatened to sue him if he did.
  
___
  
**Amazon**, **Walmart**, **Target**, and **Babylist** have pulled weighted infant sleepwear like swaddles, blankets, and sleep-sacks from their shelves amid ongoing concerns over the safety of the products and after receiving a letter from the Consumer Product Safety Commission asking major retailers to remove them from stores. Studies haven’t been able to irrefutably  demonstrate the risks of weighted infant sleepwear, however, experts are adamant that weighted products are not safe for infants and claim that the proposed benefit does not outweigh the danger — which is pretty much the same argument lawmakers are using to force the sale of TikTok.
  ___

  
Remember that **couple from Utah** who accidentally shipped their cat to Amazon in a return package? Well, the cat and her family have since been reunited. After she was discovered, an Amazon employee took the cat to a vet where her microchip was scanned. The couple was contacted and promptly flew to California the next day, rented a car, and drove back home with the cat.
___
Plus 10 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **T-Mobile** completing its $1.35B acquisition of Ka’ena Corporation, the parent company of **Mint Mobile** and **Ultra Mobile**. The deal was first announced last March, and the FTC finally approved the deal over a year later. Ryan Reynolds will continue to serve as Mint’s ambassador, and the company will continue to offer its $15/month 5GB data plan.

# Technical analysis of major markets May 6 – 11

***Last week in the news***

As it was expected, the Fed held interest rates without change at their FOMC meeting held on 1st May. Market nervousness prior to the meeting brought back some higher volatility. The USD modestly weakened, while gold ended the week testing $2.3K level. The US Treasury yields dropped after the FOMC meeting trading session and especially weaker than expected US jobs for April, reaching 4.5%. Weaker jobs data supported positive sentiment for the US equities, where S&P 500 was brought back to the level of 5.120. The crypto market had another highly volatile week, but still manages to end it with a little change from the week before. Bitcoin slipped to the $57K support, but dip buyers managed to return the price above the $63K during the weekend.

The major event during the previous week was the FOMC Meeting, held on 1st May. The Fed's rate decision and a view on current economic developments was widely expected by the market, considering inflation in the US, which is picking up slowly. This was acknowledged by the Fed, as well as a still strong labour market. Still, they noticed that the economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in Q1. The Fed continues to hold on to their 2.0% inflation target, in which sense, the first rate cut might be, and most probably, will be postponed. At this moment, no one could provide information with high certainty whether there will be one rate cut during this year, but the markets are currently estimating September with a 54% probability, while the majority of market participants switched their view on December this year.      

While the US is delaying rate cuts, the market is expecting to see the ECB to cut interest rates at their June meeting. Economists are now discussing that such a course of action would weaken the euro which might put pressure on the growth of the Euro Area. At the same time, a small rate cut will most certainly not impact any significant credit demand, in which sense, it will not provide too much assistance to companies operating within the Euro Area.

Another relevant news for the previous week was that the co-founder and ex-CEO of Binance crypto exchange was sentenced with four months in prison, after pleading guilty for money laundering at his crypto exchange. Although it was expected that he would get at least three years of prison sentence, the court took into account CZ\`s deal with the U.S. government in November last year and a settlement of $4.3 billion. At the same time, experts are noting that his personal wealth, estimated at $33 billion, would not be affected by the court decision.

There have been a lot of discussions during the previous period regarding the sale of investment units from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and its impact on the price of BTC. As news is reporting, Grayscale finally experienced the first total funds inflow, after quite a long time of funds outflow. As Farside Investors are reporting, there has been a total $63 million in inflows during Friday. As a reminder, Grayscale was the first BTC fund, but due to its high fees, the funds BTC holdings decreased from 600.000 down to 290.000 since the first BTC ETF was approved.  

***Crypto market cap***

Market nervousness regarding Fed's next moves in light of inflation pick-up was also evident on the crypto market during the previous week. Namely, as frenzy over crypto ETF\`s and BTC halving is over, the crypto market, and especially BTC, are returning to the general market sensitivity to macro developments. Right before the FOMC meeting, BTC reverted to the down side and reached levels below $57K within quite a short time. After the meeting Fed Chair Powell's speech brought back some investors into the crypto market, while weekend trading pushed the crypto market to levels above the end of the week before. Although it was extremely volatile week, still, total crypto market capitalization was increased by 1% from the end of the week before, where it has been added total $32B. Daily trading volumes were also increased to the level of $130B on a daily basis, from $104B traded a week before.  Total crypto market capitalization increase from the end of the previous year, currently stands at $655B, which represents a 40% surge from the beginning of this year.

The majority of altcoins were traded in a mixed manner during the previous week. During the week BTC was on a losing side, however, weekend trading brought back its market cap to the previous levels, and even increased it by 1.6%, adding total $20B to its total market value. On the opposite side Ether did not manage to regain previous strength, and ended the week around 1.4% lower from the week before, losing around $5.6B in value. This time major altcoins were among higher gainers. In this sense, Solana was leading the altcoin market with an increase in value of 7.3% w/w, adding total $4.5B to its market cap. DOGE was another altcoin with significant weekly performance, with an increase in value of 12.6% adding total $2.6B to its cap. This week XRP managed to add $1.17B to its value, increasing it by more than 4% w/w. Relatively solid weekly performers in relative terms had Bitcoin Gold, which increased its cap by 8.4%, Pokladot surged by 8.5%, Filecoin was up by almost 8%, while Polygon was up by 5.3%. Several coins were on a losing side, like NEO, with a decrease in value of 4%, Uniswap was down by 1.5%, while Litecoin was down by 2.5%.  

Developments within circulating coins relaxed a bit during the previous week. Ether decreased the number of its coins on the market by 1.6%, which is not so frequently seen. Miota had an increase in its coins in circulation by 0.6%, the same as traditionally, Filecoin. Tether increased its market cap and number of coins in circulation by 0.2% this week.

***Crypto futures market*** 

For another week in a row major developments on the crypto market were occurring during the weekend trading sessions, hence, futures from Friday\`s trading on the CME are not fully reflecting the actual developments on the crypto spot market. In this sense, Monday trading sessions on the futures market might bring some corrections.

BTC short term futures ended the week around 1.8% lower from the week before, while those maturing within a longer time frame, were last traded lower by more than 8%. Futures maturing in December this year reached the last price at $62.590, and those maturing a year later closed the week at price $67.250.

ETH short term futures were last traded down by around 1% on average, while those with longer maturity were down by more than 5%. ETH futures maturing in December 2024 closed the week at $3.138, and those maturing in December 2025 were last traded at price $3.297.

# Bitcoin: tight road toward $65K

# 

https://preview.redd.it/g4j8gczc7tyc1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=20647909428c60d58a89afc82041d3673e3ce8d7

BTC is moving back to the mainstream sensitivity, after the frenzy over the first ETF approval and BTC halving was over. It was clearly evident during the previous week, when the market nervousness regarding Fed's decision and view on economic developments was too high. Namely, increasing inflation in the US is putting in question whether the Fed will have a manoeuvre space to decrease interest rates till the end of this year. As market sentiment is moving between less than three rate cuts and no-rate-cuts this year, the asset classes are experiencing their market volatility. Now the BTC is also in this class.    

Wednesday was the day when the FOMC Meeting was held, and also a day when the price of BTC strongly moved to the down side and reached its lowest weekly level at $56.873. The price held around the level of $57K for some time. However, the rest of the week brought back dip buyers, which moved the price to the higher ground and its weekly highest level at $64.713 on Saturday. The RSI was strongly pushed to the downside, however, a clear oversold side was not clearly reached. Instead, the indicator stopped at the level of 33 and reverted back toward the level of 49, where it is ending the week. The market is still not ready to pass the line of 50, which would indicate that it is currently eyeing the overbought market side for one more time. Moving average of 50 days stopped its divergence from MA200, however, the convergence move has not started yet.

Current charts are not showing a higher potential for higher grounds for BTC in the following period. BTC is currently testing the $63K resistance line, but it seems that there is not enough market strength to push the price to the higher levels. At the beginning of the week some short reversal might be possible. There is some probability for the support line at $60K to be tested for one more time. On the opposite side, if the level of $63K is broken to the upside, then BTC\`s next level would be the $65K. However, at this moment, charts are showing a low probability for such a move for the week ahead. 

# EURUSD: in a reversal mood



https://preview.redd.it/wzozrjkd7tyc1.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fd8183874a8259700f583c6bafdac1e6958bd5b

Major event during the previous week was the FOMC Meeting, held on 1st May. Market was closely watching Fed Chair Powell's speech, considering recent emerging inflation. The main question for the market was when the Fed will make the first move to cut interest rates? The Fed\`s rhetoric has not changed much. They acknowledged that the inflation is slowly taking the up course, in which sense; they will keep current interest rates on hold. Currently, it is questionable whether the Fed will cut interest rates during the course of this year. The market is anticipating with a 54% probability the first rate cut in September, while the majority of market participants switched their expectations for December this year.

Non-farm Payrolls in April surprised the market with only 175K added jobs, while the expectations were at 243K for the same period. The unemployment rate in April was modestly increased to the level of 3.9%, from 3.8% posted for the previous month, and also expected by the market. Average hourly earnings were increased by 0.2% in April, a bit lower from 0.3% estimated by the market. ISM Services PMI in April was standing at 49.4, lower from market estimate of 52.0, while CB Consumer Confidence for the same month was at level of 97.0, and lower from estimated 104.0. ISM Manufacturing PMI for April was standing at 49.2, lower from expected 50.0. 

The inflation rate preliminary for April in Germany is 2.2% on a yearly basis, a bit lower from the market forecast of 2.3%. Unemployment rate in Germany in April was 5.9%, unchanged from the previous month. The GDP growth rate in Germany flash for Q1 was standing at 0.2% a bit better from forecasted 0.1%. The GDP growth rate for the Euro Zone for the same period was 0.4% on a yearly basis, which was better from estimated 0.2%. Core inflation in the Euro Zone preliminary for April was 2.7%, a bit higher from 2.6% forecasted by the market.

At the start of the week right before the FOMC meeting, the market was favouring USD, where its highest weekly level reached 1.065 against Euro. However, the rest of the week the currency pair was traded in favour of Euro, where the highest weekly level reached was at 1.081 on Friday's trading session. Still, the eurusd is ending the week at the level of 1.076. The RSI entered into a clear path toward the overbought side, reaching the level of 53 as of the end of the week. Interestingly, moving averages of 50 and 200 days are still moving as one same line, still not providing a clear indication whether there has been a cross or not.  

The market was initially set on three rate cuts during the course of this year, however, at this moment the question is emerging whether the Fed will have manoeuvre space to cut rates till the end of this year. The market is currently trying to find the equilibrium for this sentiment, in which sense, there might be further weakening of the USD. The resistance line at 1.08 was only touched on Friday\`s trading session, which leaves the space for the market to clearly test it during the week ahead. In case of a short term reversal, the currency pair might reach the level of 1.07, however, at this point on charts, the support line at 1.067 looks far away.

Important news to watch during the week ahead are: 

Euro:    ECB monetary Policy Meeting Accounts

USD: Michigan Consumer Sentiment preliminary for May. 

# SPX: challenged recovery?

# 

https://preview.redd.it/xkur8b7e7tyc1.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d9062cba5682bba1811ea363acda9d807c1188a

Markets tried to stay on a positive side after the FOMC meeting, however, the April\`s job report was the one that saved the market optimism during the previous week. Although the Fed noted that the first rate cut will occur when data clearly show that the inflation is on a clear road toward the 2.0% target, a much softer than expected jobs report was the one that moved the equity market to the upside during the Friday\`s trading session. The S&P 500 is ending the week at level of 5.129, or 0.55% higher from the end of the week before.

The tech companies were mostly the ones which pushed the market to the upside. There has been a lot of discussion about Apple's earnings which missed the target, but the company announced its largest share buyback of $110 billion, which pushed its price even 6% higher. The semiconductor stocks were also traded higher, where Nvidia rose around 3%.

The current sentiment on the market is led toward the overbought momentum. This means that there is a space for the index to move to the higher grounds from current ones. However, the next ATH is highly questionable at this moment. 

# Gold: relatively calm

There have been a lot of macro developments during the previous week, including FOMC meeting and softer than expected US jobs data, which left the gold outside of the investors focus. However, those with a significant prior exposure took the chance to close positions and book some profits. In this sense, the price of gold was in a sort of reversal during the week. It started at the level of $2.345, however, during the week it traded much lower, trying to break the $2.300 support line to the downside. Still, the price of gold is ending the week at the level of $2.300.

The RSI clearly entered into reversal mode, finishing the week at the level of 50. The market is currently eyeing the oversold market side. Moving average of 50 days is still strongly diverging from its MA200 counterpart, not indicating that potential trend reversal might come anytime soon.

It is evident from charts that the price of gold is on its short reversal path. It will start the week by testing the current support line at $2.300 with higher probability that this level could be breached to the downside. However, considering that during the week ahead there are no significant macro news set for a release, it should not be expected that the price could go much lower from the current levels. 

# US 10Y TREASURY: space for further relaxation?

During the previous period the market was trying to price its expectations of a less than three rate cuts during the course of this year, giving up on the Fed's announcement from the latest FOMC meeting. The meeting held on May 1st, showed that the market was right in its assumptions, considering that the emerging US inflation might put halt on rate cuts this year. This was also confirmed by the Fed Chair Powell in an after the meeting speech, considering that the Fed will stay devoted to the 2.0% inflation target. Treasury yields reacted during his speech, however, the major impact on 10Y Treasury yields had an April jobs report.  The weaker than expected nonfarm payrolls, as well as, increased unemployment to 3.9% in April from 3.8% posted for the previous month, were main triggers for 10Y Treasury yields to reach the lowest weekly level at 4.45%. Still, they are ending the week at 4.51%.

The market will slowly digest the new information during the week ahead. Still, some further relaxation in the 10Y Treasury yields might be expected. However, they first need to test the 4.5% level before they start their move toward the 4.4%. ",LABEL_1

2024-04-29 14:06:24,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket including analysis of USDJPY after intervention and TSLA positioning,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1cfxfu0/im_a_full_time_trader_and_this_is_everything_im/,"**ANALYSIS:**

* Let’s look at and analyse the main things happening in premarket first of all. 
* Firstly, the Yen intervention, which Japan’s Kanda hasn’t confirmed but reports are out from DJ that thats what happened this morning. 
* We saw yen weaken to 160 vs the USD. This was touted by JPM as the intervention point that BOJ were looking at, although their commentary last week was all very much vague. 
* When we saw 160 hit, we saw a big drop in USDJPY, as yen squeezed higher. 
* The price action was more extreme because Japan has a national holiday today, hence trading volumes were thin. 
* WE saw it drop from 160 to 154.5
* It found support from the technicals at the 20 day Moving average, as we see below:
* We saw recovery above the 155 level. 155 is one of the key gamma levels, where there is a lot of put support there. The bigger key gamma level, below this is 152. There is a hell of a lot of put support at 152. If the BOJ wants the yen to meaningfully improve vs the USD, it needs to get USDJPY below 152. Thats when we can go meaningfully lower. Above there, and we expect it to find support from these gamma levels and move higher, as we saw it do from 155. 
* Skew actually points higher in USDJPY now. This tells us that traders are not really expecting much more meaningful intervention right now. We can see USDJPY move higher again soon. Probably won’t be as effective as BOJ hoped. 
* Now the other key news from premarket, is TESLA, who have now received the regulatory approval for FULL self driving in China, rather than the limited product they had on offer already. 
* Tesla is pumping in premarket. 
* If we look at the gamma levels, we see 200 as having a lot of open interest. As such, we can see it as a magnet for price action moving forward. 
* FTSE pushed higher to 8200, but we see skew lowering. This tells us traders are hedging for price action to mveo lower now. The move is likely close to done for now, except if the Fed support move higher. We expect that because OTM delta isnt really showing much call delta so traders aren’t betting FTSE goes much higher. 
* HKG50 breakout from downtrend since 2023 continues, hitting 18k level today. 18k is v big gamma level, hence why we saw price action reverse from here. 
* In SPX, we see traders unwind some of their hedges as they bet that geopolitical pressures are mostly behind us. We see that too, as oil skew points lower which suggests traders expect oil to move down soon. 
* Finally, busy week ahead. 
* This week ahead, we have FOMC decision on Wednesday, as well as jobs numbers throughout the week, which will give us some insight into the labour market. 
* Put on top of that all the following earnings reports, and we are set for a volatile week of trading. 

DATA LEDE:

* Spain inflation rate:
* 3.3% YOY vs 3.4% expected, previous reading was 3.2%
* SO ticked up from last month, but not as much as expected. 
* GERMAN inflation rate:

MARKETS:

* SPX set to open above 5100 this morning, pulled up by Tesla and Aapl. Currently trading at 5112. This is just above the highs of Friday. 
* Nasdaq: up 0.3% in premarket, trading at 17,780. 17,850 is a resistance, then The next big resistance will be the 18k level. 
* Dow Jones: Flat in premarket, trading at 38,300. 
* HKG50 up 1% again in premarket. Now at 17,750. Touched 18k then came down from there. 18k is now the strong resistance. 
* UK100 higher to 8200, pared slightly to 8180. Still up 0.4% today. 
* GER40: flat around 18,140.
* Oil: Flat at 83.65. Maintaining the uptrend drawn since December 2023. 
* GOld: Flat above 2300. 
* VIX: Vix flat at 15.22. last week closed perfectly at the put support of 15. Was a big VIX crush last week. Opened today at 15.22. 

FX:

* USDJPY closed Friday at 158.3.
* In early Monday trading, it moved up to 160. This was a key level where traders were hedging for intervention.
* It seemed as though we did get that fX intervention hence the big decline.
* This decline was right down to 154.5
* This is where the 20 day Moving average was and so it found support there.
* Also a key gamma level at 155. 
* It moved below this level, before recovering above again. 
* Note: its a national holiday in Japan, hence why more exaggerated trading on thin volumes. 
* Despite this no official comment from BOJ that they have intervened, although that is the clear assumption. 
* So Yen squeezed higher after hitting 160 vs USD
* All other currencies quite flat compared.
* GBPUSD up 0.3% to 1.253EURUSD same trend, up 0.2% after selling off on Friday. Now at 1.071. On Friday, it retested 1.07 before pushing higher.

**ANALYSIS:**

* Let’s look at and analyse the main things happening in premarket first of all. 
* Firstly, the Yen intervention, which Japan’s Kanda hasn’t confirmed but reports are out from DJ that thats what happened this morning. 
* We saw yen weaken to 160 vs the USD. This was touted by JPM as the intervention point that BOJ were looking at, although their commentary last week was all very much vague. 
* When we saw 160 hit, we saw a big drop in USDJPY, as yen squeezed higher. 
* The price action was more extreme because Japan has a national holiday today, hence trading volumes were thin. 
* WE saw it drop from 160 to 154.5
* It found support from the technicals at the 20 day Moving average, as we see below:
* We saw recovery above the 155 level. 155 is one of the key gamma levels, where there is a lot of put support there. The bigger key gamma level, below this is 152. There is a hell of a lot of put support at 152. If the BOJ wants the yen to meaningfully improve vs the USD, it needs to get USDJPY below 152. Thats when we can go meaningfully lower. Above there, and we expect it to find support from these gamma levels and move higher, as we saw it do from 155. 
* Skew actually points higher in USDJPY now. This tells us that traders are not really expecting much more meaningful intervention right now. We can see USDJPY move higher again soon. Probably won’t be as effective as BOJ hoped. 
* Now the other key news from premarket, is TESLA, who have now received the regulatory approval for FULL self driving in China, rather than the limited product they had on offer already. 
* Tesla is pumping in premarket. 
* If we look at the gamma levels, we see 200 as having a lot of open interest. As such, we can see it as a magnet for price action moving forward. 
* FTSE pushed higher to 8200, but we see skew lowering. This tells us traders are hedging for price action to mveo lower now. The move is likely close to done for now, except if the Fed support move higher. We expect that because OTM delta isnt really showing much call delta so traders aren’t betting FTSE goes much higher. 
* HKG50 breakout from downtrend since 2023 continues, hitting 18k level today. 18k is v big gamma level, hence why we saw price action reverse from here. 
* In SPX, we see traders unwind some of their hedges as they bet that geopolitical pressures are mostly behind us. We see that too, as oil skew points lower which suggests traders expect oil to move down soon. 
* Finally, busy week ahead. 
* This week ahead, we have FOMC decision on Wednesday, as well as jobs numbers throughout the week, which will give us some insight into the labour market. 
* Put on top of that all the following earnings reports, and we are set for a volatile week of trading. 

DATA LEDE:

* 3.3% YOY vs 3.4% expected, previous reading was 3.2%

* Dow Jones: Flat in premarket, trading at 38,300. 
* HKG50 up 1% again in premarket. Now at 17,750. Touched 18k then came down from there. 18k is now the strong resistance.

# Last week in the news

Latest PCE data in the US are showing persistent inflation, decreasing inventor’s expectations of a potential three rate cuts during this year. US Treasury yields reacted to change in sentiment, where the 10Y benchmark reached its weekly highest level at 4.73%. Decrease of geopolitical risks in the Middle East impact short reversal in the gold price, ending the week at  $2.337. The US equities were traded in a mixed manner, but still, the S & P 500 advanced more than 2.7% on a weekly basis. The crypto market has had a relatively volatile week, with BTC shortly slipping to levels below $63K during weekend trading. On 1st may Fed's rate decision is scheduled, which might bring back some higher volatility on the market.

Inflation continues to be the main concern of investors in the US. As per Fed\`s favourite inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index was increased by 2.8% on a yearly basis in March, slightly higher from the market expectations of 2.7%. On the other hand, posted data show that the personal saving rate dropped 0.4pp in March, which was a decrease of 2 % compared to last year. Investors decreased their expectations of potential three rate cuts to only two during the course of this year. As per CME Group FedWatch gauge, the market is currently estimating two rate cuts with a 44% probability rate. At the same time, consumers are not giving up on spending. As per latest data, Personal spending is up by 0.8% in March on a monthly basis, while dip in savings shows most probably that consumers are currently digging into their savings in order to make purchases. 

A new package of laws has been adopted in the European Parliament during the previous week with the aim to further strengthen the regulation related to anti money laundering. The new laws are also addressing large cash payments and crypto companies, among others. By new laws, “obliged entities”, including crypto firms, will be obliged to report suspicious activities, as they are defined by laws.

News is reporting that ARK Invest sold the last of its BITO holdings of around $6.7 million on Thursday. The shares in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF were bought during the end of last year in anticipation of the approval of the first spot BTC ETF on the market. Just to note that the fund founded its own ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) with the aim to invest in spot BTC.  

A Pennsylvania based Republic First Bank is the first bank in the US in 2024 to be seized by regulators. Namely, all business news are reporting that this bank has been seized by Philadelphia authorities on Friday. During the previous period, the Bank was looking for a potential buyer, where Fulton Bank had reached an agreement with FDIC to take over a total 32 branches of the Republic First Bank. The shares of the troubled bank were traded down by 60% on Friday. As news is reporting the bank had about $6 billion in total assets and $4 billion in total deposits as of the end of January this year. 

# Crypto market cap

As frenzy over Bitcoin halving ended during the previous week, the crypto market is slowly returning to its “old” trading mode. Speculative positions have been closed, which pushed modestly the price of BTC toward the downside during the whole previous week. Selling orders were prevailing, supporting price volatility. Although it might sound like a paradox, analysts are still in agreement that this is positive for BTC, as it needs to finish one cycle in order to start a new one.  As of the weekend, total crypto market capitalization dropped by 2% compared to the week before, where around $57B was wiped out from the market. This decrease was led by BTC as the coin lost $41B in value during the week. Daily trading volumes continue to decrease, where during the previous week they were moving around $104B, which is a drop from $128B traded two weeks ago. Total crypto market capitalization increase from the end of the previous year, currently stands at $623B, which represents a 38% surge from the beginning of this year.

Weekend trading session brought another losing session for BTC. It\`s value dropped by 3.2% on a weekly basis, dragging market cap down by $41B. On the opposite side, ETH managed to add to its value during the week, increasing it by 1.6%, adding $6.2B to its market cap. Altcoins were also traded in a mixed manner during the week. There was a sort of equal number of both gaining and losing coins on a weekly basis. Among gainers was Tron, which increased its cap by 8.5% during the week. Binance Coin managed to hold its value relatively steady, increasing it by modest 1.5%. Algorand managed to gain 3.25% during the week. On the opposite side some of the major altcoins were traded down during the week. Solana lost 8.4% in value, losing $5.6B in market cap. DOGE was traded down by more than 10%, decreasing its value by $2.38B. Cardano joined the group of losing coins, with a total drop of 9.2% or $1.6B on a weekly basis. One of the highest losers in relative terms was Filecoin, with a total drop of 12%.   

During the previous week there has been a lot of developments when it comes to the number of circulating coins. For the first time in a while, there has been a significant increase of Ethereum\`s coins in circulation by even 1.6% on a weekly basis. Litecoin is also one which should be especially mentioned, as this coin had a surge of its coins on the market by 4.2%. Filecoin added a new 0.6% of coins. On the opposite side were Monero and Binance Coin, which significantly decreased their number of coins on the market. Monero had a drop of 5.1%, while BNB\`s were down by 1.3% within a single week.

# Crypto futures market 

Although crypto futures were holding relatively steady during the previous week, still, the major development which occurred during the weekend, have not been priced on a Friday\`s closing on the CME. In this sense, some drop in BTC\`s short term futures is possible with a first trading day on Monday.

BTC short term futures ended the previous week with a drop of around 0.3% on a weekly basis. At the same time, the long term ones were last traded higher by around 1.6%. Futures maturing in December this year were closed at price $68.520, while those maturing a year later were traded at $73.330.

ETH futures had an increase for all maturities. The short term ones were traded higher by around 2.0%, while those maturing with a longer maturity period were traded around 3.0% higher on a weekly basis. December 2024 closed the week at price $3.337, and December 2025 was last traded at price $3.481. 

# Bitcoin: a relaxation time?    

The frenzy over the Bitcoin halving is over, so the price could enter into a sort of relaxation, seeking for its new equilibrium. This is sort of normal on financial markets, considering that many positions were open in order to gain in a short bull-run. Such positions are now being closed and some sort of repositioning is taking place. Analysts are noting that this is not at all a bad thing for BTC. One cycle is close to its end, and it needs to happen in order for BTC to enter into a new one. During the previous week BTC was mostly traded with prevailing selling orders. The highest weekly level reached was $67.350 at the beginning of the week. The rest of the week, BTC was traded lower, while during the weekend trading the coin reached its lowest weekly level, dropping at one moment below the $63K.

The RSI dropped below the level of 50, indicating that market participants are now eyeing the oversold market side. In this sense, some further corrections in price are possible in the coming period. Moving average of 50 days is slowing down its divergence from MA200, however, there is still a large distance between two lines, so the cross is not in store for some time in the future.

It is evident on charts that BTC is in correction mode at this moment in time. They also show that the end of the correction cycle might be found around the support line at $60K. Still, it doesn’t mean that this level will be reached during the week ahead. First, BTC needs to test a strong support line at $63K, before it makes a clear breach toward the lower grounds. As per current charts there is probability that the $60K will be a final oversold market momentum from where the BTC could start its new cycle to the upside.

# EURUSD: FOMC week 

The inflation in the US continues to be persistent, putting into question promised three rate cuts during the course of this year. Released data on the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price index show an increase in March of 2.8% on a yearly basis, which was slightly above market estimate of 2.6%. The PCE on a yearly basis was standing at 2.7%, again modestly higher from 2.6% expected by the market. Personal income was up by 0.5% in March on a monthly basis, while personal spending was higher by 0.8% in March, and again, missed market estimates at 0.6%. As per CME Group FedWatch gauge, the market is currently estimating two rate cuts with a 44% probability rate.

As for other indicators published for the US, Durable Goods Orders were higher by 2.6% in March from the previous month and modestly above market estimates of 2.5%. The first estimate of the GDP Growth Rate for the first quarter of this year completely missed market estimates with a level of 1.6% compared to 2.5% expected by the market. Michigan Consumer Sentiment final for April was a bit decreased to the level of 77.2, from 77.8 estimated by the market.

HCOB Manufacturing PMI Flash for April in Germany was standing at 42.2 in line with the market estimate. The Ifo Business Climate for Germany in April was modestly increased to the level of 89.4, from 88.9 expected by the market. GfK Consumer Confidence in Germany for May stands at -24.2 modestly better from market estimate of -25.9

The currency pair started the previous week around the level of 1.062. During the whole week the market was oriented toward the upside, where the highest level reached was 1.075. However, the currency pair is ending the week at 1.069. The 1.067 resistance line has been tested and clearly breached during the week; however, the next resistance at 1.08 has not been reached. This leaves some space for the currency pair to test this level in the week ahead. Moving averages of 50 and 200 days since the end of March are moving as one line, leaving no indication whether the cross actually occurred or not. Such a situation is not quite frequent on charts, but it occurs from time to time.

For the week ahead it should be considered that the FOMC meeting is scheduled for May 1st. This day might bring high volatility on markets, so some stronger moves in eurusd might be possible after the meeting. As previously noted, there is a high probability that eurusd will test the next resistance line at 1.08. Some higher levels could occur but with quite low probability. On the opposite side, the currency pair might test 1.07 level, eventually 1.067 for one more time, but it is not so likely at this moment on charts.  

Important news to watch during the week ahead are:

Euro: Inflation Rate preliminary for April in Germany and Euro Zone, Unemployment rate in Germany in April, GDP Growth Rate flash for Q1 for Germany and in Euro Zone,  

USD: CB Consumer Confidence in April, ISM Manufacturing PMI in April, FOMC Meeting and rate decision, Non-farm Payrolls in April, Unemployment Rate in April, ISM Services PMI in April

# SPX: Fed implied volatility?   

Previous week was the one where the S & P 500 performed in an excellent manner, increasing its index value by 2.7%. The three-week losing track was finally broken, and the index ended the week at level of 5.124. For one more time, tech companies were the ones that were driving the market to the upside, especially after strong earnings from Microsoft and Alphabet. However, it should be noted that META was on a losing track of 10% due to its higher capital expenditures forecast. More earnings reports are set to be released in the week ahead, focusing on Amazon and Apple.   

In addition to the forthcoming earnings reports, it should be considered that the Fed's rate decision is set for May 1st. This might bring some further volatility to the markets, especially now, when markets are giving up on a previous Fed\`s promise over three rate cuts till the end of this year. In this sense, investors are currently strongly focused on what the Fed has to say in an after the meeting statement. Then it will be clearer, whether the current market optimism for equities will hold also in the future period.

# Gold: finding new equilibrium     

As the crisis in the Middle East is slowly calming down, the price of gold is ending its uptrend, in a quest to find a new equilibrium price. On this path, the price of gold first needs to find again its negative correlation with the USD, as it did during the times without significant news from geopolitics. The price of gold started the week with a strong selling side. The lowest weekly level was reached at Tuesday\`s trading session at the level of $2.293. After that move, the price reverted a bit ending the week at level of $2.336.

The RSI finally exited the strong overbought side, ending the week around the level of 58. Although the indicator still did not cross the 50 line, there is evidence that the market entered into a reversal mode, where a clear path toward the oversold side could be expected soon. Moving average of 50 days still continues to diverge from its MA200 counterpart, and still not providing an indication that potential change in trend might come soon.

As the gold market is calming down, it should be expected to return to its previous course of negative correlation with the USD. It should be considered that the FOMC Meeting and Fed's rate decision will occur on 1st May, when some higher volatility on markets could be expected. In this sense, some volatility in the gold price should also follow. Current charts are showing a modest potential for the upside, at least till the level of $2.800. However, there is currently higher potential for the downside, at least till the level of $2.300, with uncertain move lower to the downside.

# US 10Y TREASURY: all eyes on Fed       

Released data for the US economy during the previous week could point to the stagflation moment in the US during the course of this year. Posted data for core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price index show that in March it increased by 2.8% on a yearly basis, from 2.6% expected by the markets. At the same time, the first estimate for the US GDP Growth Rate was 1.6% for the first quarter of this year, while the market was expecting to see the figure of 2.5%. As it is evident that the inflation will persist during the course of this year, markets have decreased their expectations on three rate cuts for this year. As per CME Group FedWatch gauge, the market is currently estimating two rate cuts with a 44% probability rate.

One more week markets spent eyeing higher yields for US Treasuries, in order to adjust their previous estimates to new available information and sentiment. Although 10Y Treasury yields started the week around 4.6% level, they were looking for the higher grounds during the week, reaching the highest weekly level at 4.73%. Still, yields relaxed a bit during Friday\`s trading session, when they returned to the level of 4.66%. The market nervousness will continue during the week ahead, considering that the FOMC meeting and Fed's rate decision is scheduled for the 1st May. Any new information that Fed Chair Powell shares with markets will be immediately priced through yields. Based on current charts, there is some probability for yields to reach 4.8%, but it should be taken with precaution. On the other hand, there is also high probability that yields have peaked, and that some relaxation might be expected in the coming period. What is certain at this moment, is that markets will continue to trade in a nervous manner until they finally hear the Fed's decision and their perception on the US economy and potential future rate cuts.

2024-04-25 13:49:35,How BVM and reliable oracles can speed up Bitcoin transactions by 10 times,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/1ccpxbf/how_bvm_and_reliable_oracles_can_speed_up_bitcoin/,"L2 blockchains are like the turbo boosters of Bitcoin, making it faster and more versatile. But to truly supercharge them, we need tools like BVM and reliable oracles.

What's BVM? BVM is like a magic toolbox for developers working on L2 blockchains. It lets them build all sorts of cool stuff, from gaming platforms to finance apps, right on top of Bitcoin.

Why does BVM matter? Because it's modular, meaning developers can mix and match different parts to create exactly what they need. Plus, BVM keeps adding new tools to its toolbox, like the recent Filecoin module for affordable storage and the AI Contracts Library for smart contracts powered by artificial intelligence.

How do oracles fit in? Oracles are like messengers that bring real-world data into the blockchain world. Imagine a L2 blockchain for betting on sports scores. Oracles would fetch the latest scores from reliable sources and feed them into the blockchain, ensuring fair and accurate results.

The likes of SupraLabs are the unsung heroes of L1 blockchains, ensuring they have the real-world data they need to thrive. With supraoracles at their disposal, developers can build innovative applications that push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of cryptocurrencies. 

Why are reliable oracles important for scaling Layer 2? L2 blockchains can't do everything on their own. They sometimes need to check real-world info, like stock prices or weather forecasts. Reliable oracles make this possible by providing accurate data feeds.

In conclusion: BVM and reliable oracles are like Batman and Robin for Layer 2 blockchains. Together, they make it possible to build amazing things on top of Bitcoin, while keeping everything running smoothly and securely.",LABEL_2
2024-04-25 10:26:28,Bitcoin Price Prediction Analysis Post-Halving,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ccmqws/bitcoin_price_prediction_analysis_posthalving/,"Utilizing Vertex AI from Google Cloud, the analyst team at Spot On Chain has conducted rigorous modeling to forecast Bitcoin's price movements. Here's a concise breakdown of their predictions:

**Short-Term Outlook (May-July 2024):**

They anticipate Bitcoin prices to fluctuate between $56,000 and $70,000 during May, June, and July 2024. This interval signifies potential volatility in the market, with a notable 48% probability assigned to the scenario where BTC prices might dip below $60,000. Such forecasts indicate a cautious approach, acknowledging the possibility of short-term fluctuations or corrections in the price.

**Mid-Term Projection (Second Half of 2024):**

&#x200B;

In the latter half of 2024, they expect significant movement, with a 63% probability of Bitcoin reaching $100,000. This forecast signals a bullish sentiment prevailing in the market, further fueled by the anticipated rate cuts after the FOMC's December 2023 meeting, aiming to bring the federal funds rate down to 4.6%. These cuts may boost demand for risk-on assets like stocks and Bitcoin.

[Fig 1. Equities \(proxied by S&P 500\) and Bitcoin have been positively correlated.](https://preview.redd.it/0ya9bhduzkwc1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2291f155db4a24b0e8d0fcd1cce3385ad80be076)

[ Fig 2. S&P 500 tends to rise after the FED cut rates.](https://preview.redd.it/wlnplilb0lwc1.jpg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34514403775af88b5075b158ac943c3782510143)

**Long-Term Perspective (First Half of 2025 and Beyond):**

Looking further ahead, into the first half of 2025, they notice a compelling probability of BTC surpassing the $150,000 threshold. Specifically, there is a 42% chance assigned to this scenario, reflecting a bullish outlook for Bitcoin's price trajectory. Moreover, the likelihood of Bitcoin exceeding $150,000 amplifies to 70% when considering the entire year of 2025.

[ Fig 3. A new all-time high tends to be seen around 6 to 12 months after the halving event.](https://preview.redd.it/udmug45d2lwc1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7cfd48ddc1ff172204f48daafd2f598f1f027a1)

**Methodological Considerations:**

The SpotOnChain's analyst team built the models upon a comprehensive dataset, encompassing various historical trends and market drivers. Factors such as Bitcoin halving events, interest rate cycles, ETF performance, VC adoption of new cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin miner selling pressure history are meticulously incorporated into the models. However, it's essential to acknowledge the inherent limitations and uncertainties associated with predicting the future of Bitcoin.

**In conclusion:** 

This forecasts provide valuable insights into Bitcoin's potential price trends, aiding investors in navigating the cryptocurrency market, but should not be construed as guarantees of future performance. 

Will Bitcoin halving history repeat itself this time?

2024-04-24 14:16:18,I'm a professional trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket including full detailed earnings summaries for all the major companies reporting,107,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TearRepresentative56/comments/1cbwno0/im_a_professional_trader_and_this_is_everything/,"FOR ANALYSIS SECTION, PLEASE SEE THE POSTS I HAVE MADE ON THE SUBREDDIT THIS MORNING. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* Yesterday, US PMI came out weak, especially on the manufacturing side which slipped into contraction. 
* Manufacturing PMI came 49.9 vs 52 expected. First negative reading of this year. 
* Service PMI came 50.9 vs forecast of 52. Lowest reading since November.
* AS a result, DXY dropped from a above 106 to the 105.66 support.

TODAY:

* Japan Service PPI comes 2.3% ahead of forecasts and previous readings of 2.1%
* Australia Inflation:
* Came 3.6% YOY vs 3.4% expected
* Whilst hotter than expected, still down from last month’s 4.1%. Continues trend of disinflation
* Came 1% QOQ vs 0.8% expected. 
* So overall, came hotter than expected. 
* Hawkish for AUD
* GeR FO Business Climate (Apr)
* Current conditions came out at 88.9 vs 88.7 expected. More or less in same range as previous months. No improvement nor worsening in German economy
* Expectations came slightly better than expected, at 89.9 vs expectations of 88.9. Not much difference, but this improvement in expectations came as result of ECB rate cut hopes.
* US MBA Mortgage Apps 
* Mortgage applications decline 3% WOW, as 30 year mortgage rate rises on higher bond yields. 
* US Durable Goods (Mar) 

MARKETS:

* SPX: Flat at 5075. This is more or less where market closed yesterday. However, did move higher to 5092 in after hours before paring those gains a bit. 
* NDX: Trading flat at 17,540. High in premarket was 17,600 but failed to hold and got rejected off of this level. 
* DJI: Trading flat at 38,500. Note that this is a key level. 
* GER40: Flattish, rejected off of 18,200. Moved higher by 1.3%. Very strong recovery with US market. 
* FTSE100 breaks above 8100, but 
* HKG50 pumps through 17k level. Now trading at 17,221. Strong breakout of downtrend since start of 2023. 
* CHINA50 flat at 12,230
* Oil: slightly lower again, back to 82.88. Trying to hold uptrend, since December, but geopolitical ease will make it come down. 
* GOld: slightly lower again, to 2315 level. 2300 is the key level that gold needs to hold. 
* VIX crushed like crazy yesterday too, now below 16. Was at 21 on Friday. So massive Vix crush this week. This will help markets move higher. 

FX:

* After hawkish Australian CPI, where it came hotter than expectations and hotter than previously, we see AUD trading higher. 
* CHF trades slightly lower
* Dollar was lower yesterday after weak PMI. HAs recovered some of those losses today, but is only slightly higher. 

**EARNINGS:**

TESLA:

* Basically, the fears about margins failed to materialise here, as gross margin and auto margin come in ahead of expectations. Expectation was low into the print. 
* There are some analysts arguing that these numbers are being inflated by FSD revenue recognition. And that with 3-5% price cuts and 20% lower deliveries, gross margins shouldn’t have been 17.4%, when Q4 revenue was 17.6%. WE will learn more of this when 10-Q comes out.

2024-04-22 10:06:41,Pepperstone: A Traders’ Week Ahead Playbook: Buy the dip or sell the rip?,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/XGramatikInsights/comments/1ca58kt/pepperstone_a_traders_week_ahead_playbook_buy_the/,"Authored by ChrisWeston  
 

We move on from a week where strong momentum markets (AI names, NAS100, JPN225, Mexican peso) were sold down hard, with traders better buyers of the VIX, US30, gold, CHF, USD, and defensive equities (utilities).

Notably, the NAS100 recorded its worst week since November 2022, driven in part by market players part-liquidating an incredibly extended position in Nvidia, with 87m shares traded on Friday alone. Tesla and Super Micro Computers also seeing steep declines on the week, with Tesla remaining front and centre with Q124 earnings due after-market on Tuesday – many ask whether we see a fifth consecutive quarter where shares closed lower on the day of reporting?

**Long US30 / short NAS100** positions have worked well and remain a tactical play I like into the new week - although with so many heavyweight tech names reporting (see Michael Browns [**preview**](https://pepperstone.com/en-gb/market-analysis/q1-24-magnificent-seven-earnings-preview-by-the-numbers/)  
**)** through the week, NAS100 shorts will watch the reaction to earnings closely and will be prepared to react if the market likes what they see from the respective outlooks.

While sentiment has turned more negative, there is absolutely no panic at all and I’d to see if the buyer’s step in and support the S&P500 a little lower into 4935. That said, the price action and technical set-up suggests selling rallies in the US500 and NAS100 is the play – and if one is compelled to ‘buy dips’, then waiting for the rip after early traders buy the dip seems the higher probability play.

Geopolitical headlines remain fluid and have been a key reason for keeping buyers of risk at bay – many will remain focused on these developments as we roll into the new week. The news flow was certainly a key reason why **gold closed higher for a fifth straight week and at a new all-time closing high on Friday**, as it was why the CHF was the star currency on the week.

That said, with Brent crude closing the week 3.1% lower, one could argue **it was the move higher in US bond yields – with the US 10yr Treasury pushing above 4.6% - that was really the big kicker** that **promoted rotation out of tech/AI names and supported the USD.**

Short GBPUSD and long USDMXN on any retracement remains a compelling trade on my radar.

**Watch US PCE inflation on Friday** as the marquee risk on the data front – for a playbook, we could see outsized market moves on a US core PCE print above 0.4% m/m (USD up, gold, NAS100 down) or below 0.25% m/m (USD down, NAS100 and gold higher). A read above 0.4% m/m and the idea of a cut before the US Presidential election would be further dialled back.

There will be a focus on the BoJ meeting, but it is too soon for them to alter policy, and the market gives a change in rates no chance at all. If we get a move in the JPY, it will likely come from any changes to the bank’s inflation forecasts and the post-meeting conference call. We remain on JPY intervention watch, and signs that we are getting closer to the point where Japanese authorities look to step up the fight against JPY's weakness.

PMIs are due in the UK, EU, and US and they could move markets, notably if the service’s PMI outcome misses/beats expectations by a wide margin. Australia Q1 CPI poses a risk to AUD exposures, although, with such little priced into Aussie interest rate futures, it would need to big surprise to have a lasting effect on AUD pairs.

Bitcoin moves past the highly anticipated halving and while we predictably didn’t get any kneejerk reaction in price, the set-up on the higher timeframes is starting to look more compelling from the long side. There was clear support from the market to buy on the move below $60k and this is a level many are guiding for stops on longs. An upside break of $66k could be the trigger for a push into the top of the range of $72k.Good luck all.

## Key event risk for traders to navigate:

**Monday**

* **China 1 & 5-year Loan Prime Rate decision** (11:15 AEST / 14:15 BST) – No change expected with the 1-year rate left at 3.45% and the 5-year rate at 3.95%.

**Earnings** – SAP (Germany) – one to watch for clients trading the GER40, with SAP holding a 10% weight on the index.**Central bank speeches** – BoE’s Benjamin speaks (19:05 AEST / 10:05 BST)**Tuesday**

* **EU HCOB manufacturing and services PMI** (18:00 AEST / 09:00 BST) – Service PMI eyed at 51.8 (from 51.5 in the prior read) & manufacturing at 46.5 (from 46.1)
* **UK S&P manufacturing and services PMI** (18:30 AEST / 09:30 BST) - Services at 53.0 (53.1) & manufacturing at 50.4 (50.3)
* **US S&P Global manufacturing and services PMI** (23:45 AEST / 14:45 BST) - Services at 52.0 (51.7) & manufacturing at 52.0 (51.9)

**Earnings** – Tesla (after-market), Visa (after-market)**Central bank speeches** – BoE Haskel (18:00 AEST), BoE Huw Pill (21:15 AEST), ECB Nagel (22:30 AEST)**Wednesday**

* **Australia Q1 CPI** (11:30 AEST / 02:30 BST) – The economist consensus looks for headline CPI at 0.8% QoQ / 3.5% YoY (4.1%), and the trimmed mean CPI measure eyed at 3.8% YoY (from 4.2%). With Aussie interest rate futures pricing in just one rate cut in 2024, it would take a big beat/miss vs consensus to drive significant volatility in the AUD, with the AUD more sensitive to geopolitical headlines and broad market sentiment.
* **Mexico Bi-weekly CPI** (22:00 AEST / 13:00 BST) – the consensus is for headline CPI to come in at 4.49% (4.37%) and core CPI at 4.38% (4.41%)

**Earnings** – Lloyds (UK), Boeing (before-market), IBM (after-market), Meta (after-market)**ThursdayAnzac Day** – ASX200 closed.**Earnings** – Barclays (UK), Caterpillar (before-market), Alphabet (after-market), Intel (after-market), Microsoft (after-market)**Central bank speeches** – ECB’s Schnabel speaks (00:00 AEST and 17:00 AEST)**Friday**

* **Tokyo CPI** (09:30 AEST / 00:30 BST) – headline CPI is eyed at 2.5% (2.6%) and core CPI at 2.2% (2.4%) – shouldn’t be a volatility event for the JPY or JPN225
* **Bank of Japan** meeting with updated GDP and inflation forecasts (no set time but likely between 12:00 and 15:00 AEST / 03:00 to 06:00 BST) – no change in policy expected, so the focus falls on the bank's inflation projections and the post-meeting conference call.
* **ECB 1- & 3-year CPI expectations** (18:00 AEST / 09:00 BST)
* **US core PCE inflation** (22:30 AEST / 13:30 BST) – headline PCE inflation is expected at 0.3% m/m and 2.6% y/y (from 2.5%) and core PCE at 0.3% m/m and 2.7% y/y (2.8%).

**Earnings** – Exxon (Before market), Chevron

2024-04-18 14:19:26,Unveiling $GLAD/$GDTRF: A Copper Investment Primer for the Looming Copper Crisis - Why I am in on GDTRF + BMNR Looks Phenomenal at these levels,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1c71x0p/unveiling_gladgdtrf_a_copper_investment_primer/,"Hello everyone! Today, I'm zeroing in on $GLAD/$GDTRF, a stock that could be your hedge against the impending copper crisis. Read on to understand why this might be your golden ticket in the commodity surge. Communicated disclaimer, nfa.

**TLDR:** Amid global copper shortage forecasts, $GLAD/$GDTRF stands out as a promising choice.

https://preview.redd.it/jp0k42hxc8vc1.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=865d4f1a32d2b914d958b4848e25ee720061d944

**The Copper Crunch:** As highlighted by leading financial insights from Goldman Sachs, BNN, Bloomberg, and others, we're skating towards a significant copper deficit. Goldman Sachs recently announced that the copper market is expected to hit its tightest point since 2021, forecasting a 428kt deficit against a mere 260kt of visible stock. Remember the 25% price surge in 2021 due to a 444k deficit? Now, imagine the scenario in 2035 with a projected 10m ton deficit. It’s clear: as demand outstrips supply drastically, copper prices are poised for an unprecedented rise.

**Why $GLAD/$GDTRF?** Located in the mineral-rich Yukon, $GLAD/$GDTRF boasts a copper deposit with quadruple the average grade and proximity to infrastructure in Whitehorse, which significantly cuts down capital expenditure. They are currently drilling 10,000m to establish a high-grade resource. With Canada accelerating the production timeline for critical minerals, $GLAD/$GDTRF’s high-grade, accessible deposits are perfectly poised to meet burgeoning demand.

**Strategic Leadership:** The leadership team at $GLAD/$GDTRF is not new to mining successes. With veterans from Snowline Gold, Dolly Varden, K92, and First Quantum, their collective experience and a substantial personal investment in the stock underscore their commitment to $GLAD/$GDTRF’s potential.

**Detailed Technical Analysis for Gladiator Metals Corp (GDTRF)**

**Recent Price Trends:** Gladiator Metals Corp (GDTRF) closed the most recent trading day at $0.2709, reflecting a slight increase of 0.52% from the previous close. This uptick is part of a broader trend where the stock has shown significant volatility within a 52-week range of $0.1500 to $0.6000.

**Volume and Volatility:** The stock's trading volume on the last day was relatively low at 2,600 shares compared to its average volume of 14,925 shares. This lower volume indicates less trading activity which might typically suggest less investor interest or consolidation phases. However, low volume can also lead to increased price volatility as each trade has a relatively higher impact on the price.

**Technical Indicators:**

1. **Moving Averages:** GDTRF is currently showing bullish signals as it trades above its shorter-period moving averages. This suggests that the stock is in an upward trend in the short term. If it maintains its position above these averages, it might indicate sustained upward momentum.
2. **Fibonacci Retracement:** From the last peak and trough, Fibonacci levels would provide potential resistance and support levels. The next resistance would likely be near the 0.2900 mark, a common retracement level which could be tested if bullish sentiment continues.

**Investment Outlook:**

* **Current Market Cap:** $14M – A sleeper poised for valuation adjustments.
* **Price Targets:** Short-term - $0.30, $0.33, $0.36, $0.40, $0.69, $0.72, $0.78; Long-term - $2.97.
* **Strategic Advantage:** Low operation costs, high-grade deposits, and a seasoned management team set to leverage the upcoming copper squeeze.

If you're looking to diversify into commodities, especially copper, $GLAD/$GDTRF warrants attention. Let’s discuss more below and share your top picks as we navigate these exciting times!

Now, for BMNR -

We have seen some absolutely incredible gains since my first look at it, and it seems like we have a lot of room to roam!

I am still extremely bullish! especially as we approach the halving date and as we hit a significant support level for BTC!

2024-04-15 14:18:24,"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket, including a look at positioning after this weekend's events, and a look at Goldman Sachs Earnings Report",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1c4krll/im_a_full_time_trader_and_this_is_everything_im/,"**ANALYSIS:**

* On Friday we got a big VIX squeeze, as VIX jumped over 25%. This came as positioning on VIX was very short. This set up, coupled with the risk catalyst of the geopolitics in Middle East, led to a run up in Vix. 
* Despite all the doom and gloom bear porn over the weekend, and all the talk of a potential WW3, unsurprisingly, we are up in premarket this morning. 
* We got a sense that this could be the case by watching the crypto market on the weekend, which was the only market that was open adn therefore was the only market reacting in realtime to the unfolding events. 
* We saw an initial sell off on Saturday after the attacks, but when Iran mentioned that they had concluded their attacks and don’t intend on further escalations, we saw BTC and ETH start to recover. This was then reinforced by America’s recommendation to Israel to not push for a rash response. 
* If Israel don’t announce a major response, then we can expect VIX to come down, dollar to cool a bit, and equity markets to have a bit of a relief rally. 
* For all the doom and gloom, think about it, Nasdaq is still trading at 18,111, where all time highs is at 18,400.
* Then some people want to be bearish on this market?
* VIX is up 25%, and yet Nasdaq is still trading just 1.6% below highs. 
* This is still a v strong market, and the top is not in. 
* Regardless, Even if we see markets pare this gain and turn red on the day, which is not impossible with retail sales to come, this is definitely a buy the dip opportunity imo. I mean we can say that with certainty when we look at what happened in previous wars. Look at what happened when Ukraine war got announced, and when Hamas and Israel got into war. 
* Markets short term dip, before sustained rally highge.r
* Same thing will happen again. To be honest, I HOPE the market dips a bit. That’s how much I want to buy this dip. 
* If we look at other signals, we can see that the Nasdaq McCellan Oscillator is below 40. This generally stands to be a. Good buy signal. Every single time for the last two years including wars and conflicts and the FED, that this indicator has hit -40 or below has led to big bounces and most times more initiation of uptrend. Both RSI and MACD are at levels of support as well.
* [https://imgur.com/a/1EdcGPm](https://imgur.com/a/1EdcGPm)
* VIX isn’t everything BTW guys. Yes VIX jumped a lot, but this isn’t the only risk indicator. That’s what someone who doesnt understand markets in a. Detailed way would say. 
* If we look at credit spreads, which are arguably more of a risk indicator, we see they are very contained even as VIX spiked.
* No real concern here either.
* [https://imgur.com/a/MKB7gQE](https://imgur.com/a/MKB7gQE) 
* If we look at positioning, there is still some hedging, but traders are lifting thier hedges a bit because of the news on the weekend that Iran won’t continue.   
 
* VIX being above 16 is stopping any real rally up. We want to see that come down. 
* Money flows show traders are buying ahead of earnings. 
* Option Flow show mostly selling of puts. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* Japan Machinery orders negative again, but better than last month. This is a minor data point. 
* China, 1 year medium term lending facility rate - which is the main rate that central bank lends to commercial bank, kept stable at 2.5%
* Swiss Producer prices come out -2.1% YOY, more or less where it has been at since January. CHF flat on this 
* Eurozone industrial production comes in weaker than expected, at -6.4% YOY vs forecast of -5.5%. Came in more or less in line with last months reading. 
* US retail sales is the main one for today, expected to maintain strength of consumer.expected to rise for 2nd consecutive month. 

**MARKETS:**

* SPX coming off back of worst week in 2024 due to big VIX jump (by 25%) on increasing risks in Middle East. 
* Currently green up 0.5% to 5150. This is due to the fact that Israel and Iran are showing that they likely won’t escape much further
* Nasdaq is up above 18,114. Up 0.54% today. Really and truly, for all the bearishness, Nasdaq is barely down from its ATH
* Dow - Up 200 points
* GER40 is up 1.3%. Traders are buying the dip back to 18k. Sign of confidence too following weekend developments as if it was seen to be v bearish, Europe would surely be red. 
* UK100 - Up 0.72% back to the 8k level. 
* money flow data shows strong money flows into UK, after years of money flows out of the market. 
* HKG50 up nearly 1% back to 16,500 after dropping on Friday 
* CHINA - Note: China announce Q1 GDP numbers tomorrow. 
* Oil is actually slightly red, with WTI trading at 84.5, down 0.8% today. This is a sign that traders are paring their expectations of full fledged conflict in Middle East, which dominated narrative on Friday. 
* GOLD down slightly on similar reason to above, lower safe haven appeal.   

* VIX slightly lower today, back below 17 but still abvoe key 16 levle. 

**FX:**

* Ahead of Retail sales, we see dollar flat/slightly lower as the Middle East geopolitical situation calmed a bit with Iran saying they have no plans to continue aerial attack
* JPY lower this morning. This has USDJPY Pushing close to 154. No real catalyst, just persistently weak positioning and the fact that BOJ may or may not do intervention. 
* GBPUSD higher this morning, after dropping to low from friday at 1.243. Will come close to testing 1.25 today.
* AUDUSD slightly higher today. 
* EURUSD is trading just above 1.065 ahead of US retail sales. 
* CHFUSD flat/slightly higher. 
* Not much happening in FX market overall ahead of retail sales, except in Yen.

**IRANIAN GEOPOLITICS:**

* Key developments that the market will be looking to digest today were to do with the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. 
* From Friday, we saw Iran threatening retaliation attacks on Israel after their Iranian embassy in Damascus was hit 2 weeks ago. VIX pumped, and markets dropped.
* The main story of this is:
* On Saturday, Iran launched hundreds of UAVs (suicide drones) at Israel
* Iran said they had warned the countries in the neighbouring geography 72 hours in advance
* With the help of US and UK, Israel were able to intercept 99% of these drones before they entered Israeli airspace. 
* Israel said that they will be looking to retaliate to this attack.
* US warned Israel not to have a rash response. They said they are worried Israel are trying to drag them into a wider conflict. 
* US equity markets and FX markets were closed over the weekend so we didn’t see any initial response to the market. This was probably good for the markets, as in the crypto markets, we did see some sell off. BTC and ETH dropped by around 10% as markets feared further escalation.
* However, on Sunday, we saw Iran say that Tehran has no plans to continue aerial attack on Israel. They said their retaliation for attack on tis diplomatic compound in Damascus is now ended. 
* Iran said they do not want to raise tensions in Middle East, but that their attacks were necessary
* This took the sting out of the developments and that’s why markets are flat/green right now. 
* Israel seemingly makes clear to US on US requests hat they are not looking for significant escalation with Iran.
* All world leaders are calling for some restraint from Israel and Iran in the Middle East, as they understand the repercussions. 
* Even Kremlin is saying they do not want further escalation in the region. 

**OTHER NEWS:**

* Goldman Sachs for first time say that there is a chance that we get 0 rate cuts from the Fed this year. 
* Aluminium prices surge to highest level in decades after sanctions on Russian metal industry by US and UK. This is also the case for Copper and Nickel.

**ANALYSIS:**

* On Friday we got a big VIX squeeze, as VIX jumped over 25%. This came as we mentioned a lot of times that positioning on VIX was very short. This set up, coupled with the risk catalyst of the geopolitics in Middle East, led to a run up in Vix. 
* Despite all the doom and gloom bear porn over the weekend, and all the talk of a potential WW3, unsurprisingly, we are up in premarket this morning. 
* We got a sense that this could be the case by watching the crypto market on the weekend, which was the only market that was open adn therefore was the only market reacting in realtime to the unfolding events. 
* We saw an initial sell off on Saturday after the attacks, but when Iran mentioned that they had concluded their attacks and don’t intend on further escalations, we saw BTC and ETH start to recover. This was then reinforced by America’s recommendation to Israel to not push for a rash response. 
* If Israel don’t announce a major response, then we can expect VIX to come down, dollar to cool a bit, and equity markets to have a bit of a relief rally. 
* For all the doom and gloom, think about it, Nasdaq is still trading at 18,111, where all time highs is at 18,400.
* Then some people want to be bearish on this market?
* VIX is up 25%, and yet Nasdaq is still trading just 1.6% below highs. 
* This is still a v strong market, and the top is not in. 
* Regardless, Even if we see markets pare this gain and turn red on the day, which is not impossible with retail sales to come, this is definitely a buy the dip opportunity imo. I mean we can say that with certainty when we look at what happened in previous wars. Look at what happened when Ukraine war got announced, and when Hamas and Israel got into war. 
* Markets short term dip, before sustained rally highge.r
* Same thing will happen again. To be honest, I HOPE the market dips a bit. That’s how much I want to buy this dip. 
* If we look at other signals, we can see that the Nasdaq McCellan Oscillator is below 40. This generally stands to be a. Good buy signal. Every single time for the last two years including wars and conflicts and the FED, that this indicator has hit -40 or below has led to big bounces and most times more initiation of uptrend. Both RSI and MACD are at levels of support as well.
* [https://imgur.com/a/1EdcGPm](https://imgur.com/a/1EdcGPm)
* VIX isn’t everything BTW guys. Yes VIX jumped a lot, but this isn’t the only risk indicator. That’s what someone who doesnt understand markets in a. Detailed way would say. 
* If we look at credit spreads, which are arguably more of a risk indicator, we see they are very contained even as VIX spiked.
* No real concern here either.
* [https://imgur.com/a/MKB7gQE](https://imgur.com/a/MKB7gQE) 
* If we look at positioning, there is still some hedging, but traders are lifting thier hedges a bit because of the news on the weekend that Iran won’t continue.   
 
* VIX being above 16 is stopping any real rally up. We want to see that come down. 
* Money flows show traders are buying ahead of earnings. 
* Option Flow show mostly selling of puts.

**IRANIAN GEOPOLITICS:**

* Key developments that the market will be looking to digest today were to do with the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. 
* From Friday, we saw Iran threatening retaliation attacks on Israel after their Iranian embassy in Damascus was hit 2 weeks ago. VIX pumped, and markets dropped.
* The main story of this is:
* On Saturday, Iran launched hundreds of UAVs (suicide drones) at Israel
* Iran said they had warned the countries in the neighbouring geography 72 hours in advance
* With the help of US and UK, Israel were able to intercept 99% of these drones before they entered Israeli airspace. 
* Israel said that they will be looking to retaliate to this attack.
* US warned Israel not to have a rash response. They said they are worried Israel are trying to drag them into a wider conflict. 
* US equity markets and FX markets were closed over the weekend so we didn’t see any initial response to the market. This was probably good for the markets, as in the crypto markets, we did see some sell off. BTC and ETH dropped by around 10% as markets feared further escalation.
* However, on Sunday, we saw Iran say that Tehran has no plans to continue aerial attack on Israel. They said their retaliation for attack on tis diplomatic compound in Damascus is now ended. 
* Iran said they do not want to raise tensions in Middle East, but that their attacks were necessary
* This took the sting out of the developments and that’s why markets are flat/green right now. 
* Israel seemingly makes clear to US on US requests hat they are not looking for significant escalation with Iran.
* All world leaders are calling for some restraint from Israel and Iran in the Middle East, as they understand the repercussions. 
* Even Kremlin is saying they do not want further escalation in the region. 

**OTHER NEWS:**

* Goldman Sachs for first time say that there is a chance that we get 0 rate cuts from the Fed this year. 
* Aluminium prices surge to highest level in decades after sanctions on Russian metal industry by US and UK. This is also the case for Copper and Nickel.

Both RSI and MACD are at levels of support as well.

* VIX isn’t everything BTW guys. Yes VIX jumped a lot, but this isn’t the only risk indicator. That’s what someone who doesnt understand markets in a. Detailed way would say. 
* If we look at credit spreads, which are arguably more of a risk indicator, we see they are very contained even as VIX spiked.
* No real concern here either.

* If we look at positioning, there is still some hedging, but traders are lifting thier hedges a bit because of the news on the weekend that Iran won’t continue.   
 
* VIX being above 16 is stopping any real rally up. We want to see that come down. 
* Money flows show traders are buying ahead of earnings. 
* Option Flow show mostly selling of puts.

**IRANIAN GEOPOLITICS:**

* Key developments that the market will be looking to digest today were to do with the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. 
* From Friday, we saw Iran threatening retaliation attacks on Israel after their Iranian embassy in Damascus was hit 2 weeks ago. VIX pumped, and markets dropped.
* The main story of this is:
* On Saturday, Iran launched hundreds of UAVs (suicide drones) at Israel
* Iran said they had warned the countries in the neighbouring geography 72 hours in advance
* With the help of US and UK, Israel were able to intercept 99% of these drones before they entered Israeli airspace. 
* Israel said that they will be looking to retaliate to this attack.
* US warned Israel not to have a rash response. They said they are worried Israel are trying to drag them into a wider conflict. 
* US equity markets and FX markets were closed over the weekend so we didn’t see any initial response to the market. This was probably good for the markets, as in the crypto markets, we did see some sell off. BTC and ETH dropped by around 10% as markets feared further escalation.
* However, on Sunday, we saw Iran say that Tehran has no plans to continue aerial attack on Israel. They said their retaliation for attack on tis diplomatic compound in Damascus is now ended. 
* Iran said they do not want to raise tensions in Middle East, but that their attacks were necessary
* This took the sting out of the developments and that’s why markets are flat/green right now. 
* Israel seemingly makes clear to US on US requests hat they are not looking for significant escalation with Iran.
* All world leaders are calling for some restraint from Israel and Iran in the Middle East, as they understand the repercussions. 
* Even Kremlin is saying they do not want further escalation in the region. 

**OTHER NEWS:**

* Yesterday we got some relief from the post CPi sell off, with Nasdaq actually recovering all of the loses, pushing back above 18,200.
* This came as AAPL pumped on M4 chip news for the new MacBooks and NVDA jumped on strong price targets. Overall Mag7 was all higher. This helped VIX to drop below 15 for some time, which helped to fuel market makers to add liquidity.
* Today we look at dollar as driving the movement in premarket. Dollar is moving higher towards the 106 level, which is sending equities slightly lower and VIX slgihtly higher.
* Looking at dollar, trading at 106 I think we can start to say that a lot of the hot CPI is now beginning o be priced in. I mean, before CPi, dollar was trading at 104.
* Positioning does look like more weakness can come in EURUSD, as traders now buy puts on 1.06. But thinking about it form a fundamental position, I am feeling more confident to begin opening positions against the dollar whilst the dollar is at these levels.
* EURUSD indicators are now also showing as oversold so I do think bounce comes soon.
* A sustained break below 15 is what I am looking for from VIX in order to push market higher again. A close above 5200 will be bullish for next week.
* We can look to inflation expectation numbers out today for a catalyst for vix to drop hopefully. Banks are moving lower slightly but the earnings weren’t really bad.
* Gold is pumping in premarket as we have been saying for some time. Is up to 2400, and positioning is very bullish still.
* If we look at Silver, positioning shows bears are dead. No put delta or gamma at all. Looks like market wants to move us sustainably higher.
* Silver positioning follows suits. Very bullish for stocks like PAAS, which is up in premarket as a result.

2024-04-12 13:35:13,I'm a professional trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket as dollar jumps and semis all lower in premarket 12/04,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TearRepresentative56/comments/1c26vsj/im_a_professional_trader_and_this_is_everything/,"For more stock specific analysis, and for more market updates, please join r/Tradingedge

**ANALYSIS:**

* See the sub for more stock specific and general market updates. 
* Yesterday we got some relief from the post CPi sell off, with Nasdaq actually recovering all of the loses, pushing back above 18,200. 
* This came as AAPL pumped on M4 chip news for the new MacBooks and NVDA jumped on strong price targets. Overall Mag7 was all higher. This helped VIX to drop below 15 for some time, which helped to fuel market makers to add liquidity.
* Today we look at dollar as driving the movement in premarket. Dollar is moving higher towards the 106 level, which is sending equities slightly lower and VIX slgihtly higher. 
* Looking at dollar, trading at 106 I think we can start to say that a lot of the hot CPI is now beginning o be priced in. I mean, before CPi, dollar was trading at 104. 
* Positioning does look like more weakness can come in EURUSD, as traders now buy puts on 1.06. But thinking about it form a fundamental position, I am feeling more confident to begin opening positions against the dollar whilst the dollar is at these levels. 
* EURUSD indicators are now also showing as oversold so I do think bounce comes soon. 
* A sustained break below 15 is what I am looking for from VIX in order to push market higher again. A close above 5200 will be bullish for next week. 
* We can look to inflation expectation numbers out today for a catalyst for vix to drop hopefully. Banks are moving lower slightly but the earnings weren’t really bad. 
* Gold is pumping in premarket as we have been saying for some time. Is up to 2400, and positioning is very bullish still.
* If we look at Silver, positioning shows bears are dead. No put delta or gamma at all. Looks like market wants to move us sustainably higher. 
* Silver positioning follows suits. Very bullish for stocks like PAAS, which is up in premarket as a result. 
* Semis are lower in premarket on China restrictions. China tells telecom carriers to phase out foreign chips. 
* AAPL positioning looks like it wants to try to consolidate around the 175 level, before move higher to 180 again.

**DATA LEDE:**

* UK GDP numbers - YOY for February fell by -0.2%, less than the -0.4% expected 
* MOM came in at 0.1%, in line with expectations
* 3 month average beat expectations for Feb, coming in at 0.2% vs 0.1% expected, and above 0% for first time in 6 months.
* That’s encouraging. The 3m average tells us the trend, so optimism that UK is moving towards the positive trend, away from recession. In truth, it is still pretty stagnant though.
* CHINA BALANCE OF TRADE NUMBERS:
* Exports tanked by much more than expected for March, down 7.5% YOY, much more than the -3% forecasted. 
* Turns negative again for first time in 6 months after a run of positive prints. 
* Imports also fell, where they were expected to increase. 
* This points to weaker global demand for China, and also weak domestic demand. China is Export driven so thats not good for the economy. 
* US Michigan Consumer Sentiment, 5 and 1 year inflation expectations, as well as current conditions. 
* Fed’s Bostic and Daly will both also be talking. 

**MARKETS:**

* VIX - dropped yesterday after spiking to 17.5, which led market makers to fuel the market with liquidity. Currently just above 15. 15 is the next support. Crush below this will send markets higher 

**FOREX:**

* EURUSD tested 1.07 after ECB decision yesterday pointed to continued likelihood of rate cuts in June. 
* Today it dives further, with traders now looking to 1.06. 
* JPM says that they see it hard to bet against the dollar right now with hotter inflation leading to stronger USD prospects, whilst ECB still on tack for June cuts. Said they expect ECB to cut rates. 
* USDJPY hits new high since 1990 at 153.34
* DXY moving higher towards 106. Broke a key resistance today. 
* GBPUSD dumps below 1.25

**MAG7:**

* AAPL - Yesterday, AAPL pumps by over 4%, on news that the new line of Macbooks will use an AI focused M4 chip. Market happy that AAPL is taking steps towards AI. First wave will debut in late 2024. 
* AAPL Mac sales were down 27% in 2023, so investors hope this will boost that side of their business. 
* AAPL also said their services revenue was doing well despite 2024 challenges, seeing 11% jump. 
* AMZN - hits first record high since 2021. 
* TSLA - Robotaxi regulators say that Tesla hasn’t contacted them about the plans that were teased by Musk.

You can review my Reddit history yourself.  You can also see in my history that I have asked for more details about Pikamoon and the direction that is charted for it.  In my normal life, I work as an auditor, business consultant, and commercial property evaluator.   I have seen and helped many poorly run businesses.  I have seen many excited new business owners buying their first commercial property, only to drive by the property a year later to see it up for sale again.  I can usually spot quickly, just from meeting the owners, if they will succeed or not.

I am going to post some bullet points below on why **I** invested in Pikamoon.  These are my personal reasons, not financial advice, but please use this to aid in your research.

* ***The creators doxxed themselves:***  There is something to the adage about standing behind your product.  I appreciate the move as it would be easy to be like any other crypto and hide behind the product.  In a world devoid of leaders, I appreciate it when creators step up and put themselves on the line for their products.  It shows me they are not afraid to be the adult in the room and do what is needed.  They are ready to take accountability.   Most of the businesses I see fail, hide behind the product, make excuses, or no one on the leadership team wants to stand up and be the adult in the room.  You end up having a room full of people who know there are big problems, but everyone keeps tip-toeing around the issues as the ship is sinking.  I feel the creators of Pikamoon are leading by example, and have put themselves on the line behind a product they believe in.
* ***The Gaming Industry is Booming****:*  Per Newzoo's article (Marie Dealessandri) gaming will be an **189.3 Billion dollar industry in 2024**.  My son has spent a lot of money on in-game assets that he does not get to keep or transfer.  Once the game is done, or he is done playing that game, those assets are now worthless.  Imagine a game where **YOU** own the assets, and can earn crypto to trade, rent, evolve, or sell your assets.  I think Pikamoon is on the leading edge of play to earn.  Pikamoon is also in a niche/genre of gaming that we know there is existing massive global support for*.*
* ***The Memecoin environment is exploding:*** Per CoinGecko (Nancy Lubale), "" In Q1 2024, memecoins [recorded](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/most-profitable-crypto-narratives) the highest returns of **1,312.6%** on average across the top tokens by market capitalization. ""  There is growing support for Meme coins in 2024 so just like Pikamoon landing in one of the most popular gaming genres, it is also in one of the most popular crypto genres as well.
* ***Card collection is still booming even after the Pandemic:***   Per 360 Research Reports, "" The Global Trading Card Game market is anticipated to rise at a considerable rate during the forecast period, between 2024 and 2031. In 2023, the market is growing at a steady rate, and with the rising adoption of strategies by key players, the market is expected to rise over the projected horizon.***""***  Pikamoon is like other popular card trading games, but instead of a cardboard card, you are getting an NFT that you hold in your crypto wallet.  It won't lose value if the corner is bent, or your buddy spilled his drink on it.  You will be able to trade, sell, and evolve, this NFT which is exciting!  I know my local stores have had to handle card releases like Black Friday sales, people are lining up at the door for the new cards.  So Pikamoon is a three-headed beast, pulling attention/investments from 3 different business sectors!
* ***Pikamoon is anti-inflationary:*** We all know inflation, it has been heavy on our shoulders for the last 3 years.  From food, housing, and consumer costs, we have all been crushed by its rise.  Our Federal Reserves keep printing cash, reducing the power of our local currencies by the second.  Pikamoon plans to burn coins as well as things like staking etc.  We all know the market is based on supply and demand.  More supply the less valuable something becomes.  By reducing supply, the value will go up with demand.  One interesting aspect of this is that Pikamoon will be deflationary to global economies, but not so in the in-game economy.   I watched a video this week of an interview with Elon Musk about Dogecoin.  I am sure you can find the video if you search for it.  a summary of what Elon said, "" It is good to have some crypto that is **NOT** anti-inflationary.  If you have a coin that is anti-inflationary you do not want to spend it.  You want to HODL it and take advantage of its growth.  Coins that are NOT anti-inflationary are good because they are meant to be SPENT.  There is no value in holding it long term as its value will decrease, you are better off spending it and getting an asset that will not lose value.""   So what does the quote have to do with Pikamoon?  Pikamoon will be anti-inflationary when compared to local fiat, but won't be in the game environment/universe.  You are incentivized to spend your Pikamoon coin to develop better assets.  It is like Pikamoon bridges two different financial ecosystems.
* ***Timing and Strategy:***  Pikamoon is launching right at the end of bear markets for crypto and video gaming.  Gaming started turning around in 2022 and we can find 1000+ articles talking about Bitcoin halving, Crypto ETF mass adoption, and countries getting into crypto and opening the markets more to their citizens.  It is also getting in the middle of the resurging card trading industry.  When successful people invest, they try to time the investment at the bottom, so they can ride that success up.  Pikamoon is positioned well as far as timing in the industries it is involved in.  We have seen the amazing marketing of Pikamoon!  I have invested in some innovative crypto projects, and they did what they said.  Their coin was not wildly successful, though,  because they were so focused on the tech, that there was little to no marketing.  We have seen all the work the Pikamoon creators are doing for marketing on top of all the work on the tech.  From Arooj Shah's March 2024 article, ""Throughout 2023 and 2024, meme coins saw remarkable growth due to several influential factors. First and foremost, social media influence played a pivotal role; endorsements from celebrities and influencers significantly boosted meme coin popularity and investment.""  The creators have given constant updates on marketing, and they know this is what will drive more interest in the project.  The creators have also started posting updates, or alpha, as they call it.  They keep putting out these announcements and then living up to those comments once they come to fruition.   We know they are working on getting on more exchanges (an announcement on another coming in roughly 2 weeks.) and we know are they growing the company physically (growth of employees and needed office space to accommodate.) as well as financially.  They are dropping breadcrumbs on the linear path to development and growth, an example the Pikamoon Hub, as well as a trailer for the metaverse coming out in about 3 weeks.

In conclusion, all these above-listed reasons are why **I** chose to invest in Pikamoon. I suggest you do your own research and make decisions on your personal financial situation.  For me, there is enough meat on the bone here to invest in Pikamoon.  I believe this is the ground floor for play to earn and still early in the crypto and card trading worlds, not a situation where I am yolo'ing at the top of the market.  In my opinion, the calculated risk is worth the potential return.  This is not financial advice, just on why I feel Pikamoon was a wise investment choice for me.

2024-04-06 23:25:35,Official Solar Eclipse thread,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/1bxmpo5/official_solar_eclipse_thread/,"# Official Information:

* **Governor Sununu had a press conference** about the solar eclipse:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3zFPS4SVU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3zFPS4SVU)
* **Official state website for the information about the eclipse:**  [https://www.visitnh.gov/solareclipse](https://www.visitnh.gov/solareclipse)
* **Official traffic advisory website:**  [https://newengland511.org/](https://newengland511.org/)
* **Eclipse viewing safety information from NASA:**  [https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/safety/](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/safety/)

Not only are people coming to New Hampshire to view the eclipse in New Hampshire, but they might be traveling through New Hampshire to get to Vermont , Maine, or Quebec.

# IMPORTANT NOTES:

* **Please keep your fuel tanks topped off** well before reaching your final destination.   These small towns are not used to having thousands of tourists flooding in at one time.  PLEASE TOP OFF YOUR TANK in a larger city before reaching your final destination.   Also keep in mind, MOST gas stations in rural areas are **NOT 24/7** so keep that in mind when planning your route.   A friend in northern Maine told me their local gas station already ran out of fuel because people were buying fuel for their generators during the recent snow storm.
* State officials have strongly **recommended AGAINST driving ELECTRIC CARS** to the eclipse.   There are only a **tiny** hand full of charging stations in the north country.
* **Give your self PLENTY of time to arrive** for the eclipse.   The worst traffic will be during the return trip home.   Maybe take a nap in your car before departing home to avoid the worst of the return traffic.
* **Almost all hotels in the area are full.**  You might need to travel quite a ways from the eclipse totality path to find an available afordable hotel.  Those vacancies that still do exist are thousands of dollars.
* **The cell phone networks are going to be overwhelmed,** many areas don't have any coverage at all.   Do not rely on your cell phone for navigation.
   * Apps like **Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze normally use the cell phone network** to download the maps in real time as you are using it, but Google Maps also allows you to download offline maps before departing on your trip.   I highly recommend downloading offline maps or an offline navigation app like ""[Osmand](https://osmand.net/)"".  Also, keeping an old fashion paper road atlas in your car is always a good idea.
   * If you are in an area with little or no cell phone coverage, it might be a good idea to turn off your phone or put your phone in to ""Airplane Mode"" to save battery.   Your phone might waste a lot of energy trying to connect to a cell network or competing with the thousands of other phones in the area.
* **Your GPS might be wrong!**   Up north there are many seasonal roads, and abandoned logging roads that are not passable.  Many GPS's including Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze still try to route people down these paths.  Use common sense, don't get your car stuck.   Again, most cell phone navigational apps reply on the cell phone network, make sure to download some offline maps before you depart.
* **Bring CASH.**  Enough cash to buy a full tank of gas and food.   Not all small town stores and restaurants take credit cards or bitcoin.  Many places will have food trucks, but if the cell phone network is overwhelmed, they won't be able to process credit cards or bitcoin.
* **It's MUD SEASON, plus there is a foot of snow on top of the mud.**   State officials have ordered all tow trucks to prioritize tows that might be blocking traffic.  If you get stuck in the mud in the middle of nowhere, you're going to be waiting for a long time.  It's easy to get stuck on what appears to be shallow snow on the road shoulder, so be careful where you park.   A good shovel, a tow strap, and knowing the tow points of your vehicle are a good thing to have in your vehicle.  **Prepare to self-rescue.**
* **Stay off the ice.**  Lakes and ponds are still frozen, but the ice is too thin to support the weight of people.
* **Please bring enough food and water** to sustain everyone in your car for an extended period of time.   Much smaller events can often overwhelm these small town grocery stores and restaurants.
* **Please bring extra clothes, warm layers.**  It's been nice and warm, but we are going to be experiencing lows in the 20's and even worst windchills.   Including extra shoes and socks, because it is mud season.   It might also be a good idea to pack a sleeping bag for everyone in your car, just in case.
* **Prepare to walk long distances.**   Many cities/towns in totality are having designated parking areas that might be away from viewing events.  You may need to walk a long distance from your parking spot.
* **Please respect private property.**   DO NOT trespass on private property, nor park in peoples driveways, nor drive through their fields.
* **Give your car a pre-trip inspection before driving up north.**  Check your tire pressure, check your oil, check your lights, etc.
* **Make sure you got eclipse glasses, and make sure they are legit**, there are many fakes on the market.  You should test them now, the sun should be the only thing visible through eclipse glasses, sunglasses are not dark enough.  Even many welding helmets are not dark enough.   Only use binoculars, telescopes, or cameras that are equipped with the proper solar filters.
* **Please support the local economy.**   Although many of these stores and restaurants might be overwhelmed, if you can, please stop and shop at a local store.  Remember, **New Hampshire has NO SALES TAX**.  So if you've been thinking about making a big purchase, considering stopping on your way home to make that major purchase in NH and save some money.
* **Please check the local town/city/park websites and social media of where you are planning on going.**  Some towns like Burlington, VT have special traffic and parking instructions for visitors.
* **The weather forecast for all of New England is looking very clear.  We're very lucky.**

The other members of the group chimed in to say, ""I am looking forward to today's transaction,"" ""I have been waiting for the teacher’s investment instructions🤞🏻,"" ""I will pay attention to the group information,"" etc. Several additional people joined the group via evite link.

Several other group members dutifully posted pictures of their trades. I asked, ""Why am I receiving these cringe-inducing, illiterate, emojified texts about a crypto scam? This is embarrassing."" My message was promptly deleted, and I was removed from the group.

* Why would some stranger be eager to teach you how to make money for nothing? This alone should make you suspicious.
* No legitimate businessperson will contact you via unsolicited WhatsApp message.
* No financial professional communicates in emojis.
* The sales pitch does not clearly explain *how* you will profit. There is no clear business strategy, just a black box labeled ""investment.""
* These people are very obviously misrepresenting themselves. ""Davis"" makes grammatical and diction mistakes that betray he is not a native English speaker. His name is not Davis. Lorna, if she exists, is not a brunette bombshell named Lorna. These photos are stock photos or otherwise stolen.
* They immediately silence and kick out anyone who points out the above.

2024-05-24 08:13:51,Pepperstone: The implications of an ETH spot ETF – Tactical plays for ETHUSD traders ,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/XGramatikInsights/comments/1cze2sp/pepperstone_the_implications_of_an_eth_spot_etf/,"Authored by ChrisWeston

The crypto scene has its focus on the formal blessing from the SEC to allow ETH spot ETFs to trade in the US. Given we’ve now seen regulatory sign-off on the 19b-4 filling, which allows the regulator to understand the impact of change in rules and to efficiently scenario test the rollout of the spot ETF – the next stage will be the SEC signing off on applications (the S-1 form) made by the 9 ETF issuers, although that may not happen overnight.

What’s important is the crypto world now sees a very high probability that an ETH spot ETF will be rolled out soon. A key question therefore for traders is exactly how much of this news is now in the price, and what is the likelihood of a “buy the rumour, sell the fact” playing out? Many are now even looking ahead at what could be the next coin to have a spot ETF launch – the front runner seems to be SOL.

Using the BTC spot ETF as a guide, which was fully approved on 10 January, in the lead-up to the launch we saw a strong run-in the BTCUSD price into $49k and then a 21% correction into $38,500 over the ensuing 12 days. It was then that traders saw the upbeat aggregated daily inflows into the 10 BTC spot ETFs (ex-Grayscale) and aggressively bought back in, with BTCUSD ultimately rallying 90% to $73k.

**Daily inflows in all BTC cash ETFs**

The possibility of that same price action playing out in ETHUSD is an obvious risk, but when everyone is expecting something like this to happen, it rarely does, or at least the retracement should be far shallower. Plus, with expectations of solid inflows from investors into the ETH spot ETF, and the understanding of how influential these inflows have been on the BTC price, this understanding may even mitigate a ‘sell on fact’ altogether.

**Price action portrays strong anticipation of the ETF launch**

Looking at the rally in ETHUSD since 20 May, with price gaining 30% and pushing 3900, we can see the market has seen the potential ETF blessing as a big positive for ETH. We can also see the outperformance of ETH through the ETHUSD/BTCUSD (top pane) or ETHUSD/SOLUSD ratio.

https://preview.redd.it/m2f5e7pagb2d1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=377b1a8736d14d1c4fe2203aed3e37c29da8af82

We can also open interest in ETF futures, across the various platforms, has been steadily rising, where the notional value of all outstanding contracts sits close to a record $15b. If we then look at funding rates charged on ETH perpetual futures these have been falling consistently since March, showing that despite the move higher in the underlying price, the leverage held by market participants is still very low – a sign that we are nowhere near the euphoria stage and that price could kick higher and traders may chase.

**Choosing between the ETH and BTC spot ETF – the implications**

For potential investors in the new ETH spot ETF (assuming it does come) they would now have a choice. For many US financial advisors, who could look to suggest a crypto spot ETF to clients, it isn’t just a case of having BTC or ETH in the portfolio for diversification purposes – where due to its higher volatility and often low correlation with other asset classes, crypto can help spread portfolio variance. These advisors will now have to educate themselves fully on the key differences between BTC and ETH, and which is the better ETF to choose from.On one hand, ETH has a lower market cap and differing liquidity conditions, so inflows into the ETH spot ETF could have an even greater influence on the underlying price.Bitcoin does have a scarcity factor, which many would be aware of after the recent ‘halving’, but with reduced supply and good demand, this dynamic is supportive of the BTC price over time, with some saying BTC is a ‘store of value’ – a mantra I would currently dispute given its propensity to follow the S&P500 on big down days.Bitcoin is not a great medium of exchange though, and ETH is far better in this regard so the adoption thematic, as well as potential use case, are more supportive over the longer term for ETH than BTC.Either way, the market has seen how influential the BTC spot ETF has been in driving prices higher, so are ready to trade ETH should we see big inflows into the ETH spot ETF.Of course, we could feasibly see outflows from the BTC spot ETF and rotation into the ETH spot ETF and that may raise the prospect of sustained downside in the BTCUSD/ETHUSD ratio (traders can play this by going short of BTCUSD and long ETHUSD).

**What’s the play?**

But for those whose focus is trading ETHUSD in isolation, the question – assuming full sign-off from the SEC – is whether ETHUSD can power through 4000 and the March highs of 4092.55, or whether we see long positions reduced quickly and a 'sell on fact' playing out – I favour the former scenario, but as long as the S&P500 can stay at elevated levels, market volatility remains subdued and US bond yields don’t start to move sharply higher, then any 15% pullback on a ‘sell on fact’ should offer a compelling entry for tactical buyers.

2024-05-24 07:36:31,Bitcoin vs ETH ETF: What Happens?,159,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1czdiki/bitcoin_vs_eth_etf_what_happens/,"So by now, everyone knows that Ethereum ETF has been approved, which is great news for the market.  That said, there is an interesting interplay between the Bitcoin and the ETH ETF that will dictate the price of ETH once trading begins for these products.  Let's recap what happened with the Bitcoin ETF.

1. Bitcoin ETF:  Bitcoin ETFs first started trading in January 11th of 2024.  At that point, Bitcoin was 46.6K.  In the next few weeks, Bitcoin's price started to plummet with Bitcoin dropping 17% in January 23rd to 38K.  The main reason driving this dump was the huge unloading from the Grayscale Bitcoin fund.  Given that GBTC was charging a fee of 2.5% for its customers, many investors took this opportunity to sell their GBTC (while probably taking profit as well).  However, after a while, the inflows started to increase significantly, and this triggered a bull run from 38K to 73K (almost 100% increase) in the subsequent months.  And here we are.
2. ETH ETF:  There are three main factors for the upcoming ETH ETF:  (a) existing Bitcoin ETF (b) ETH ETF (c) Grayscale ETH ETF.  How does this all play a role?  We have good news and bad news for ETH.  In the good news, we will have 1a) new money flowing into the ETH ETF 1b) money flowing from the Bitcoin ETF to the ETH ETF.  In the bad news, we will have 2a) Grayscale money flowing out from its current ETH ETF 2b) secondary effect of Bitcoin's price that might tank due to BTC ETF -> ETH ETF.   So let's unpack this.  Right now, Grayscale holds around 9 billon dollars worth of ETH.  I suspect that Grayscale will retain its 2.5% fee and that will result in massive exodus of this fund once trading starts.  Also, right now, the Bitcoin ETFs hold around 13 billion dollars worth of BTC.  I've heard estimates that ETH ETFs will have around 15-25% funds of Bitcoin ETF.  So it is conceivable that anywhere between 1-3 billion dollars worth of BTC ETF will be converted to ETH ETF.  That is good for ETH but bad for BTC (and this might be bad for the entire cryptomarket).  Also, it is not clear how much new money will enter into the market due to ETH.  I am thinking not that much initially since much of the crypto money that was interested in the ETFs are already in ETF (e.g. individual investors) and hedge funds/banks might be already satiated with Bitcoin ETF initially.
3. So what about the price?  When trading starts happening, we will see Bitcoin ETF money go to ETH ETF, and Grayscale ETH money going out.  Clearly, this isn't good for Bitcoin in the short run as it will create selling pressure.  I suspect that the ETH/BTC ratio will go up but it is conceivable that ETH will go down initially (similar to BTC) due to Grayscale unloading.  But regardless, when ETH ETF does open, that is not the time that I would want to be holding BTC (over ETH).  And once the dust settles down, I suspect that ETH's price would make a run and any dip would be worth buying in the short-term/mid-term after its ETF launch.",LABEL_1
