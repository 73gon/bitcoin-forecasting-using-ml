2024-05-28 17:06:37,Goals for today and Friday - $21.50 today -&gt; $23.75 by End of week/Month,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/1d2lpnw/goals_for_today_and_friday_2150_today_2375_by_end/,"Based on my continued analysis with ChatGPT and NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. 

It seems $21.00 is the new battleground for GME this week. 

  
We are looking for the MONTHLY MACD cross-up by Friday which is month end. That will be the sign for momentum changing and bulls taking over, that will be a push forward, volume is needed to make a big reversal. 

12-DAY EMA: $22.26

26-DAY EMA: $20.01

9-DAY EMA: $22.13

To calculate the price needed for a monthly MACD cross up, we would need to determine the difference between the 12-day EMA and the 26-day EMA and add this difference to the current price. 

$22.26 - $20.01= $2.25

Lets say we close at $21.50 today. 

$21.50 + $2.25 = $23.75.

  
This is the big change we're looking for to start long-term bullish momentum. Thats when the buy algorithms go on and we get a big push. As retail we're not the ones in charge of the market so we need to watch out for the signs.

2024-05-28 17:19:07,I read Steam's marketing docs so you don't have to,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1d2m09c/i_read_steams_marketing_docs_so_you_dont_have_to/,"Hhere is recap of Steam's article on marketing, so you'll understand how it works to sell your game there.

# **Tl;dr**

*   \- Steam recommendations are based on time and money which determines interest, Steam doesn't forecast successes.
    
*   Curated visibility is shown to everyone and is the best marketing tool, and yes you can ask Steam to get featured there once you've reached a certain popularity.
    
*   \- There are ways to improve your discoverability like managing your tags well, localization and regional pricing.
    
*   Discovery queue is the strongest lever you can activate prelaunch.
    
*   Wishlists numbers don't matter as much as you think.
    

I'll go through the Steam's store possibilities first and then have a quick run down of Steam's advice on marketing (spoiler: nothing new here)

If you want to deep dive into all the marketing possibilities [here is my full article about Steam marketing tools](https://stepupyourgame.blog/2024/05/27/how-to-use-steams-marketing/)

# **STEAM ALGORITHMS-BASED OPPORTUNITIES**

Steam puts a lot of effort and trust into their algorithms. Their goal is to **match games with the players who will love them.**

This allows them to follow players‚Äô interests instead of trying to predict them. As with many algorithms, the more you interact with Steam, the better the algorithm gets at recommending games you will like.

**In a nutshell:**

*   **Players‚Äô interests drive visibility**, and you need to market your game to gain this interest first.¬†
    
*   **Visibility can happen after you launched** if your game is being picked up later on (like Fallout recently with their TV show or Among Us during the pandemic).
    
*   Visibility is **not impacted by refund rate or reviews** (as long as you are above mixed).
    
*   Visibility is impacted first and foremost by **revenues and play time**. It is also influenced by localization and wishlist counts.
    

**FEATURED AND RECOMMENDED:**

*   Biggest algorithm based placement

**DISCOVERY QUEUE:**

*   The best marketing tool! You can trigger it prelaunch if you reach a certain threshold of wishlist gains during a short period.
    
*   This can be done by having a new trailer, press, festival or content creator coverage generating visits on your page and ultimately converting.
    

**CURATOR RECOMMENDATION**

*   Curator system sucks on Steam but it's the place you can see curators if you follow any.

**BY DEVELOPER OR PUBLISHER YOU KNOW**

*   Quite important to create a following base for your studio and check the one from your potential publisher to see their reach.

**THE BIG BLOCK:**

*   New and Trending: pushes the best performing 1.0 games
    
*   Top sellers: Highest revenues in the last 24h, including DLC and in-game currency
    
*   Popular upcoming: Next to release games that have reached a certain number of wishlists to appear (Steam doesn't say how many but it's said to be around 7k)
    
*   Specials: Most revenues for games in discount
    

# **STEAM CURATED OPPORTUNITIES**

**Curated visibility reaches everyone** on Steam and is granted once your game has reached a certain threshold of ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù.

Steam doesn‚Äôt specify exactly how they measure it, but I would bet on a mix of players numbers, review score and revenues.¬†

*   If you want to have midweek or week-end deals you need to be on **the top ‚Äúfew hundreds best selling games on all of Steam‚Äù.**
    
*   To be featured on curated offers **you need to show Steam that your game is appealing to a wide audience** and will maximize sales. Remember that slots are limited and Steam will favor the games most likely to drive revenue.
    

**FRONT PAGE TAKEOVER:**

*   The biggest marketing opportunity from Steam.
    
*   Promotes games, publisher sales or event.
    

**SPECIAL OFFERS:**

*   You can ask Steam to get featured for a daily deal once you've reach enough revenues (Expect at least 100k$)
    
*   To get featured for a mid-week deals or week-end deals you need to be amongst the top few hundred sellers on Steam.
    

# **STEAM MARKETING RECOMMENDATIONS**

For those already looking to market their game Steam doesn't have much to offer more but here is what they recommend.

*   **Have a good game (duh)** ‚ÄúYour game is your best marketing tool.‚Äù ‚Äì Thanks a lot Steam for this impactful insight I guess.
    
*   **Show it in the best way possible** with great trailers, screenshots, relevant tags and product page.
    
*   **Market your game before launch** - get the ball rolling with building wishlists to inform players when you release
    
*   **Feedback and testing -** Use Steam's tool to test your game, playtesting, demo and Steam Next Fest are the way
    
*   **Post-launch -** Market your updates, couple them with a discount, and update your capsule art.

",83,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TearRepresentative56/comments/1d2i0lb/im_a_full_time_trader_and_this_is_everything_im/,"I've tried to improve the report today, with more explicitly mentioned high volume tickers to watch for the day, along with their catalysts, and have increased the detail in analysis section. Hope you like.

To motivate me to make more free content, please join my sub r/Tradingedge 

ANALYSIS:

* This week we see PCE data come on Friday. Expectations in the market according to the bloomberg intelligence research that I was reading, is for it to come soft or in line. Analysts are not expecting it to come hot.¬†
* Whilst some people argue that rates will have to stay higher for longer due to stickiness in inflation, I point to inflation swaps which have all fallen over the last 1 month. This for 1y, 2y, 3,y, 5y, 10y etc. Traders are still expecting inflation to come down this year, especially encouraged by the falling shelter inflation in the last report.¬†
* A look at some positioning analysis then:
* Silver and gold pumped yesterday, silver in particular, due to the geopolitical escalations between Egypt and Israel, as well as Israel and the rest of the world in Rafah. We saw strong positioning before too.
* Today, both pullback, but positioning overall v bullish, traders are buying calls on Silver at 35C. Thats a sign that traders are expecting this to be short term vol before move higher.¬†
* NVDA showing strong positioning, and is up in premarket on news that xAI will use NVDA chips in building thier supercomputer. This is brining other semiconductors with it. AMD has a bullish positioning too.¬†
* Potential high volume Names to watch today from a catalyst perspective (you can see the catalysts below) are:
* DUOL, PYPL, RIOT, DKNG, SE, CRWD, ONON
* EURUSD, GBPUSD showing bullish positioning as both come to resistance at 1.09 and 1.28 respectively. Positioning suggests we can see a break above, but let‚Äôs see.¬†
* Traders continue to favour tech, and big tech in particular as Mag7 skew makes a new yearly high. AAPL and NVDA up in premarket should be supportive of the market too.¬†
* VIX is up in premarket but expect vol crush later in the day as usual, positioning on VIX is still very short.¬†
* Please see the sub‚Äôs posts (rank by new) for more of the updates I put out ahead of the week.¬†

DATA LEDE:

* AUSTRALIAN RETAIL SALES:

ANALYSIS:

* This week we see PCE data come on Friday. Expectations in the market according to the bloomberg intelligence research that I was reading, is for it to come soft or in line. Analysts are not expecting it to come hot.¬†
* Whilst some people argue that rates will have to stay higher for longer due to stickiness in inflation, I point to inflation swaps which have all fallen over the last 1 month. This for 1y, 2y, 3,y, 5y, 10y etc. Traders are still expecting inflation to come down this year, especially encouraged by the falling shelter inflation in the last report.¬†
* A look at some positioning analysis then:
* Silver and gold pumped yesterday, silver in particular, due to the geopolitical escalations between Egypt and Israel, as well as Israel and the rest of the world in Rafah. We saw strong positioning before too.
* Today, both pullback, but positioning overall v bullish, traders are buying calls on Silver at 35C. Thats a sign that traders are expecting this to be short term vol before move higher.¬†
* NVDA showing strong positioning, and is up in premarket on news that xAI will use NVDA chips in building thier supercomputer. This is brining other semiconductors with it. AMD has a bullish positioning too.¬†
* Potential high volume Names to watch today from a catalyst perspective (you can see the catalysts below) are:
* DUOL, PYPL, RIOT, DKNG, SE, CRWD, ONON
* EURUSD, GBPUSD showing bullish positioning as both come to resistance at 1.09 and 1.28 respectively. Positioning suggests we can see a break above, but let‚Äôs see.¬†
* Traders continue to favour tech, and big tech in particular as Mag7 skew makes a new yearly high. AAPL and NVDA up in premarket should be supportive of the market too.¬†
* VIX is up in premarket but expect vol crush later in the day as usual, positioning on VIX is still very short.¬†
* Please see the sub‚Äôs posts (rank by new) for more of the updates I put out ahead of the week.¬†

DATA LEDE:

ANALYSIS:

* This week we see PCE data come on Friday. Expectations in the market according to the bloomberg intelligence research that I was reading, is for it to come soft or in line. Analysts are not expecting it to come hot.¬†
* Whilst some people argue that rates will have to stay higher for longer due to stickiness in inflation, I point to inflation swaps which have all fallen over the last 1 month. This for 1y, 2y, 3,y, 5y, 10y etc. Traders are still expecting inflation to come down this year, especially encouraged by the falling shelter inflation in the last report.¬†
* A look at some positioning analysis then:
* Silver and gold pumped yesterday, silver in particular, due to the geopolitical escalations between Egypt and Israel, as well as Israel and the rest of the world in Rafah. We saw strong positioning before too.
* Today, both pullback, but positioning overall v bullish, traders are buying calls on Silver at 35C. Thats a sign that traders are expecting this to be short term vol before move higher.¬†
* NVDA showing strong positioning, and is up in premarket on news that xAI will use NVDA chips in building thier supercomputer. This is brining other semiconductors with it. AMD has a bullish positioning too.¬†
* Potential high volume Names to watch today from a catalyst perspective (you can see the catalysts below) are:
* DUOL, PYPL, RIOT, DKNG, SE, CRWD, ONON
* EURUSD, GBPUSD showing bullish positioning as both come to resistance at 1.09 and 1.28 respectively. Positioning suggests we can see a break above, but let‚Äôs see.¬†
* Traders continue to favour tech, and big tech in particular as Mag7 skew makes a new yearly high. AAPL and NVDA up in premarket should be supportive of the market too.¬†
* VIX is up in premarket but expect vol crush later in the day as usual, positioning on VIX is still very short.¬†
* Please see the sub‚Äôs posts (rank by new) for more of the updates I put out ahead of the week.¬†

Hope you like.

ANALYSIS:

* This week we see PCE data come on Friday. Expectations in the market according to the bloomberg intelligence research that I was reading, is for it to come soft or in line. Analysts are not expecting it to come hot.¬†
* Whilst some people argue that rates will have to stay higher for longer due to stickiness in inflation, I point to inflation swaps which have all fallen over the last 1 month. This for 1y, 2y, 3,y, 5y, 10y etc. Traders are still expecting inflation to come down this year, especially encouraged by the falling shelter inflation in the last report.¬†
* A look at some positioning analysis then:
* Silver and gold pumped yesterday, silver in particular, due to the geopolitical escalations between Egypt and Israel, as well as Israel and the rest of the world in Rafah. We saw strong positioning before too.
* Today, both pullback, but positioning overall v bullish, traders are buying calls on Silver at 35C. Thats a sign that traders are expecting this to be short term vol before move higher.¬†
* NVDA showing strong positioning, and is up in premarket on news that xAI will use NVDA chips in building thier supercomputer. This is brining other semiconductors with it. AMD has a bullish positioning too.¬†
* Potential high volume Names to watch today from a catalyst perspective (you can see the catalysts below) are:
* DUOL, PYPL, RIOT, DKNG, SE, CRWD, ONON
* EURUSD, GBPUSD showing bullish positioning as both come to resistance at 1.09 and 1.28 respectively. Positioning suggests we can see a break above, but let‚Äôs see.¬†
* Traders continue to favour tech, and big tech in particular as Mag7 skew makes a new yearly high. AAPL and NVDA up in premarket should be supportive of the market too.¬†
* VIX is up in premarket but expect vol crush later in the day as usual, positioning on VIX is still very short.¬†
* Please see the sub‚Äôs posts (rank by new) for more of the updates I put out ahead of the week.¬†

DATA LEDE:

* AUSTRALIAN RETAIL SALES:

FINTRAC (Canada's financial intelligence unit and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing supervisor), initiated Project Protect in 2016 to ""improve the collective understanding of the crime, and to improve the detection of laundering proceeds from human trafficking for sexual exploitation.""

[https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/intel/operation/oai-hts-2021-eng](https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/intel/operation/oai-hts-2021-eng)

There are many indicators of money laundering for human trafficking. Notably, the article cites ""purchasing jewellery"" as an indicator ""possibly related to human trafficking for sexual exploitation,"" but the primary ways listed are:

https://preview.redd.it/7yu6ed46j33d1.png?width=2274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8b4bffd24c1c9e387cf204669ab400fba4454ca

I'm going to focus on two of these indicators:

1. companies owned by traffickers or their associates, and
2. the use of online casinos.

**#1: What is Jungle Lion?**

Jungle Lion Management Inc. was a company co-owned by Drake, Chubbs, and Sabah Nissan. See the links below for information from other redditors about Nissan:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/comments/1cvbs8i/drakes\_connection\_to\_the\_netherlands/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/comments/1cvbs8i/drakes_connection_to_the_netherlands/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/comments/1d27edf/it\_is\_right\_in\_front\_of\_us\_sabah\_nissan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/comments/1d27edf/it_is_right_in_front_of_us_sabah_nissan/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/comments/1cy3dvv/diddys\_compound\_property\_of\_drake\_affilitate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/comments/1cy3dvv/diddys_compound_property_of_drake_affilitate/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

Note that the last link highlights Sean ""Diddy"" Combs connection to Nissan. Nissan considers himself friends with Diddy, as he explained in this rare interview (you will have to translate this article):

[https://www.quotenet.nl/zakelijk/a190677/q-a-met-huisvriend-van-jamie-foxx-die-12-5-miljoen-ving-voor-amsterdams-luxe-hotelproject-190677/](https://www.quotenet.nl/zakelijk/a190677/q-a-met-huisvriend-van-jamie-foxx-die-12-5-miljoen-ving-voor-amsterdams-luxe-hotelproject-190677/)

Jungle Lion Management Inc. used to own the bar Pick 6ix alongside Drake--however it was closed in November 2019 for reasons I posted in this comment:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/comments/1d27edf/comment/l5z0vu9/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\_term=1&amp;utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/comments/1d27edf/comment/l5z0vu9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

**A legal filing by the landlord of Pick 6ix revealed that Sabah Nissan was in fact a partner of Jungle Lion Management Inc.** That's embarrassing--if anything illicit money laundering were actually happening, it wouldn't be wise to continue doing it if your identity was revealed. But, wouldn't you know it--**a new company named Jungle Lion Security was incorporated on January 30th, 2020:**

[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/drake-security-firm-1.7199013](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/drake-security-firm-1.7199013)

Similar to Jungle Lion Management Inc. before the legal filing, their ownership is not listed publicly. **But that's just a coincidence, right Mr. Nissan...?**

**#2: You got gamblin' problems...**

In 2020, Drake announced his partnership with Stake Casino:

[https://www.grandprix247.com/2023/10/11/the-drake-effect-on-stake-casino-and-its-legitimacy/](https://www.grandprix247.com/2023/10/11/the-drake-effect-on-stake-casino-and-its-legitimacy/)

Notably, this online casino accepts Bitcoin transactions. FINTRAC warned that online casinos have been shown to be hot-spots for laundering money from illicit sources:

[https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/online-gambling-sites-money-laundering-1.7087399](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/online-gambling-sites-money-laundering-1.7087399)

**Schizo connection:** The founder of Stake also founded Kick, which is a streaming competitor to Twitch. Kick offers a 95-5% split for content creators:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed\_Craven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Craven)

And you guessed it--Drake has an account, where he has live-streamed his gambling.

[https://kick.com/drake](https://kick.com/drake)

There are a few ways laundering money works in online casinos. From the CBC article posted above:

Imagine for a moment the brazenness to live-stream yourself laundering money via cryptocurrency, while accepting tips for it on a service owned by your business partner... **but this is just another coincidence, right Aubrey?**

I GOT YOU FROGGOS!,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecryptocurrency/comments/1d2a3aa/why_did_cryptocurrencies_drop_and_whats_the_good/,"Many cryptocurrencies experienced a notable decrease this evening due to several factors:

1. The U.S. SEC is expected to announce new crypto regulations soon, creating market uncertainty and prompting a sell-off.

2. After reaching new all-time highs, some investors decided to take profits, causing a market pullback.

3. Cryptos are known for their volatility. Recent price increases made the market ripe for a correction. So as it turned out, we did experience a correction. Luckily it didn‚Äôt affect us entirely. 

However, there's also good news my dear Froggos!

1. Institutional interest is growing, with Bitcoin ETFs attracting more institutional money and providing legitimacy to the market.

2.Cryptos like Cardano are making significant technological improvements, enhancing their networks and governance structures.

3. The Bitcoin Halving event- now this happens months later of everything increasing however some say that‚Äôs what‚Äôs effecting it.

4. Clearer regulations could bring stability and attract more institutional investors in the long run.

Despite the dip, these positive developments suggest a strong foundation for future growth in the crypto market.",LABEL_2

I haven't posted the long-term silver chart since last September which the fractal and symmetrical triangle was calling for this breakout but suffice it to say, the updated chart pattern (which dates back to 1935) is nothing short of phenomenal.  Studying chart patterns across both commodity and stock sectors, the silver chart pattern is indeed something to behold.

You can take this for what its worth, but looking at the BIG picture, we should move quickly to $50 (by October 2024) before any serious correction back down to $36.  This price action will complete a 100-year pattern in play, whereas silver turns around from approx. $36, smashes through $50 (on the 4th attempt) and all blue sky from there.

The % up move and parabolic trend which captures the 1st bull market from 1935 to 1980 will make triple digit silver on the low side of the projected target.  Does this imply we may very well hyper-inflate, yes it does or we simply turn the silver deficit into the biggest silver shortage any commodity has experienced.  It could be one or the other or combination and then FOMO will kick in.  This pattern is clean, precise and text book, so probability is 90% price behavior will unfold very close to the above analysis.

This would also imply corrections will be very short lived but volatile in the paper market, as the bull will shake off the weak hands and test resolve of the strong hands.  This is extremely healthy as the market works through the correction only strong hands reside in a position and short-term specs are kicked off.  But there will be no more long painful bleeds, but more big spikes in both directions taking out the big orders of both buy and sell stops, this is the whipsaw action we have seen recently and will increase, but the duration again will be short lived.  Silver REALLY wants to MOVE HIGHER but now waiting for GOLD to get its act together.  Note; we have seen a healthy drop in GSR from near 90 to 76.... don't look for the 10:1 right now as this would only imply the bull PM may have run its course.  The fact that Silver is @ $30 and GSR is at 76 is anecdotal evidence the bull has several years to run and the prices for both gold and silver will be astronomical.

For those that comment that loaf of bread will be $100 in this case, and if that turns out to be true, be thankful you have silver which could buy a truckload of bread, which is example of preserving wealth, return of the investment vs return on the investment.  Jordan Byrne stated a couple weeks ago the silver pattern (50 years) is the best he has ever witnessed...this is correct, but he was not looking at the whole picture, and again, if we have the same % move from '35 to '80, silver will have its bitcoin moment.

The purpose of the post is to not sensationalize the possibility of silver's move but to convey that from here on out, the long consolidation periods, sideways movements and containment of the big short sellers pinning silver price under $25 is over... Bix Weir after posting 1000 videos calling for the bullion banks ending the manipulation in silver has finally come to fruition, ...albeit they may have added increase short positions, they now have to buy those sells back and will need to compete with new longs entering a position and as the weak hands have already sold, the number of sellers remaining will be nada....the shorts are screwed... the PM trading desk did not get the memo, but they will, but the memo in this case will be their walking papers.  Stay long, stay strong.",LABEL_1

The growing volume of transactions has driven its price upwards. A similar trend is now observable with Litecoin.

Copium?

* Litecoin is recognized as one of the most widely used cryptocurrencies for transactions, ranking third after Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of transactional volume. Its fast transaction times and low fees make it a preferred choice for everyday transactions.

* Despite its substantial transactional use, Litecoin's market cap is significantly lower than Bitcoin's and Ethereum's‚Äîby hundreds of billions of dollars. This disparity suggests that LTC is undervalued relative to its utility and market presence.

Litecoin appears to be significantly undervalued compared to its peers. The combination of high transactional use, substantial upgrades, and growing adoption points to an upcoming surge in its price as the market begins to recognize its intrinsic value.

BTC accumulated upwards in the same way, solely through sheer use of the network and mass adoption.

2024-05-23 23:37:07,Check out the stark premium change above and below 65k,22,https://i.redd.it/sniio4fgw82d1.jpeg,"Notice the average premium between 60 and 65 (1.65) is fairly randomly consistent.  It's also randomly consistent between 65 and 70 (1.85). 
Is this because Michael Saylor's recent purchases averaged 65k on bitcoin?  Or is it because above 65k people believe the Bitcoin bullish trend is continuing and vice versa.  Whatever the reason, the $160 per share change in Microstrategy price solely due to the premium is significant.",LABEL_1
2024-05-23 15:05:08,SqueezeFinder Update - May 23rd 2024,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/1cysat6/squeezefinder_update_may_23rd_2024/,"Good morning, SqueezeFinders! Absolutely incredible conditions in the market for bullish movement for longs after that phenomenal quarter from $NVDA. So long as they don't pull it down under 1000 psychological level, I think we can assume a nice, sustained continuation of the current aggressive move upwards.

1. $MAXN: this bottomed out solar energy ticker can make a potentially outsized move to the upside if it can break over resistance levels of 3.30, 3.40, 3.60 and 4. This ticker holds a squeezability score of 64% and a juice target of 7.3 in the best-case scenario. Let's keep this one on close watch in case it can clear over that 4 level particularly for a larger squeeze move and continued bullish price action. Key support levels you want it to hold are 3.30, 3 psychological level and danger zone below 2.70. Let's keep it on watch to see how it goes today.

1. $SPWR: this new age meme stock is also among the recent squeezers from the solar energy sector and remains on high watch for potential reversal back higher again. The data is still compelling, and chart is intriguing if we can break resistance of 3.3 and 3.75 in the near-term for 4-5+ range. The squeezability data is incredibly strong on this ticker at 90% and a juice target of 13.1 in a best-case scenario. On the support side, we would like to see it hold 3 psychological level and then 2.6-2.7 are the last chance for bulls to hold any rally.

1. $MARA: the King of Bitcoin miners makes it back onto the SqueezeFinder watchlist thanks to a mix of strong data, good chart, and strong Bitcoin. The squeezability score is a modest 56% with a juice target of 42.7 in a best-case scenario. Ideally, we would like to see Bitcoin hold over 70k and push higher to help assist sentiment, and we would like to see key resistance levels of 22 and 23 break for indication of further upside trend continuation short-term.

ANALYSIS:

* This week we see PCE data come on Friday. Expectations in the market according to the bloomberg intelligence research that I was reading, is for it to come soft or in line. Analysts are not expecting it to come hot.¬†
* Whilst some people argue that rates will have to stay higher for longer due to stickiness in inflation, I point to inflation swaps which have all fallen over the last 1 month. This for 1y, 2y, 3,y, 5y, 10y etc. Traders are still expecting inflation to come down this year, especially encouraged by the falling shelter inflation in the last report.¬†
* A look at some positioning analysis then:
* Silver and gold pumped yesterday, silver in particular, due to the geopolitical escalations between Egypt and Israel, as well as Israel and the rest of the world in Rafah. We saw strong positioning before too.
* Today, both pullback, but positioning overall v bullish, traders are buying calls on Silver at 35C. Thats a sign that traders are expecting this to be short term vol before move higher.¬†
* NVDA showing strong positioning, and is up in premarket on news that xAI will use NVDA chips in building thier supercomputer. This is brining other semiconductors with it. AMD has a bullish positioning too.¬†
* Potential high volume Names to watch today from a catalyst perspective (you can see the catalysts below) are:
* DUOL, PYPL, RIOT, DKNG, SE, CRWD, ONON
* EURUSD, GBPUSD showing bullish positioning as both come to resistance at 1.09 and 1.28 respectively. Positioning suggests we can see a break above, but let‚Äôs see.¬†
* Traders continue to favour tech, and big tech in particular as Mag7 skew makes a new yearly high. AAPL and NVDA up in premarket should be supportive of the market too.¬†
* VIX is up in premarket but expect vol crush later in the day as usual, positioning on VIX is still very short.¬†
* Please see the sub‚Äôs posts (rank by new) for more of the updates I put out ahead of the week.¬†

DATA LEDE:

ANALYSIS:

* This week we see PCE data come on Friday. Expectations in the market according to the bloomberg intelligence research that I was reading, is for it to come soft or in line. Analysts are not expecting it to come hot.¬†
* Whilst some people argue that rates will have to stay higher for longer due to stickiness in inflation, I point to inflation swaps which have all fallen over the last 1 month. This for 1y, 2y, 3,y, 5y, 10y etc. Traders are still expecting inflation to come down this year, especially encouraged by the falling shelter inflation in the last report.¬†
* A look at some positioning analysis then:
* Silver and gold pumped yesterday, silver in particular, due to the geopolitical escalations between Egypt and Israel, as well as Israel and the rest of the world in Rafah. We saw strong positioning before too.
* Today, both pullback, but positioning overall v bullish, traders are buying calls on Silver at 35C. Thats a sign that traders are expecting this to be short term vol before move higher.¬†
* NVDA showing strong positioning, and is up in premarket on news that xAI will use NVDA chips in building thier supercomputer. This is brining other semiconductors with it. AMD has a bullish positioning too.¬†
* Potential high volume Names to watch today from a catalyst perspective (you can see the catalysts below) are:
* DUOL, PYPL, RIOT, DKNG, SE, CRWD, ONON
* EURUSD, GBPUSD showing bullish positioning as both come to resistance at 1.09 and 1.28 respectively. Positioning suggests we can see a break above, but let‚Äôs see.¬†
* Traders continue to favour tech, and big tech in particular as Mag7 skew makes a new yearly high. AAPL and NVDA up in premarket should be supportive of the market too.¬†
* VIX is up in premarket but expect vol crush later in the day as usual, positioning on VIX is still very short.¬†
* Please see the sub‚Äôs posts (rank by new) for more of the updates I put out ahead of the week.¬†

# Risks and Important Information

No Advice on Investment; Risk of Loss: Prior to making any investment decision, each investor must undertake its own independent examination and investigation, including the merits and risks involved in an investment, and must base its investment decision‚Äîincluding a determination whether the investment would be a suitable investment for the investor‚Äîon such examination and investigation.

Crypto assets are digital representations of value that function as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but they do not have legal tender status. Crypto assets are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not currently backed nor supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies, stocks, or bonds.

Trading in crypto assets comes with significant risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks and risk of losing principal or all of your investment. In addition, crypto asset markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing.

Crypto asset trading requires knowledge of crypto asset markets. In attempting to profit through crypto asset trading, you must compete with traders worldwide. You should have appropriate knowledge and experience before engaging in substantial crypto asset trading. Crypto asset trading can lead to large and immediate financial losses. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position quickly at a reasonable price.

The opinions expressed represent an assessment of the market environment at a specific time and are not intended to be a forecast of future events, or a guarantee of future results, and are subject to further discussion, completion and amendment. The information herein is not intended to provide, and should not be relied upon for, accounting, legal or tax advice, or investment recommendations.
